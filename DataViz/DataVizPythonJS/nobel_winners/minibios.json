Milstein shared the  in 1984 with  and  for developing the  technique for the production of .\nMilstein was born in , Argentina. His parents were M\u00e1xima (Vapniarsky) and L\u00e1zaro Milstein, a  immigrant. He graduated from the  and obtained a PhD under Professor Stoppani (Professor of ). Thereafter, he was a member of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, England, and held dual Argentine and British citizenship. In 1956, he received an award from the Sociedad Bioqu\u00edmica Argentina for his work on  with the  aldehyde dehydrogenase. In 1958, funded by the , he joined the  Department at the  at  to work for a PhD under  on the mechanism of metal activation of the enzyme . During this work, he collaborated with  whose group he joined with a short-term  appointment.\nThe major part of Milstein's research career was devoted to studying the structure of antibodies and the mechanism by which antibody diversity is generated. It was as part of this quest that, in 1975, he worked with  (a postdoctoral fellow in his laboratory) to develop the  technique for the production of \u2014a discovery recognized by the award of the 1984 . This discovery led to an enormous expansion in the exploitation of antibodies in science and medicine.\nMilstein himself made many major contributions to improvements and developments in monoclonal antibody technology\u2014especially in the use of  to provide markers that allow distinction between different cell types. In collaboration with Claudio Cuello, Milstein helped lay the foundation for the use of monoclonal antibodies as probes for the investigation of the pathological pathways in neurological disorders as well as many other diseases. Milstein and Cuello's work also enabled the use of monoclonal antibodies to enhance the power of immuno-based diagnostic tests. In addition, Milstein foresaw the potential wealth of ligand-binding reagents that could result from applying recombinant  technology to monoclonal antibodies and inspired the development of the field of antibody engineering which was to lead to safer and more powerful monoclonal antibodies for use as therapeutics.\nMilstein's early work on antibodies focused on their diversity at the amino acid level, as well as on the disulfide bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies, where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted  that contained a signal sequence. The development of the  technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of  of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody . In this process, localized mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved , which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in recent years was devoted to characterizing this mutational process, with a view to understanding its mechanism. He contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.\nQuite apart from his own achievements, Milstein acted as a guide and inspiration to many in the antibody field, as well as devoting himself to assisting science and scientists in less developed countries. It is also worth mentioning, that even though the Nobel Prize would have made him a wealthy man, Milstein did not patent his enormous discovery since he believed that it was mankind's intellectual property. According to his beliefs, his work did not have any economic interest, only scientific.\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize 1984, Milstein was elected a , was a fellow of  from 1980 to 2002, awarded the  from  in 1980, won the  in 1989, and became a  in 1995. In 1993, the Argentinian  granted him the Diamond , one of the most prestigious cultural awards of Argentina, as the most important scientist in the last decade of his country.\nMilstein married Celia Prilleltensky in 1953.\nMilstein died early on 24 March 2002 in , England at age 74, as a result of a heart condition that he had suffered from for many years.\nThe film \"Un fueguito, la historia de C\u00e9sar Milstein\" was released in 2010.

He was joint recipient (with his father, ) of the  in 1915, \"For their services in the analysis of  by means of \"; an important step in the development of X-ray crystallography.\nBragg was  in 1941. As of 2020, he is the youngest ever  in physics, having received the award at the age of 25 years (youngest ever Nobel winner in any field is , who received Nobel Peace prize in 2014 at the age of 17). Bragg was the director of the , Cambridge, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was reported by  and  in February 1953.\nBragg was born in , South Australia to  (1862\u20131942),  Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the , and Gwendoline (1869\u20131929), daughter of , government astronomer of South Australia.\nHe showed an early interest in science and mathematics. Shortly after starting school he fell from his tricycle and broke his arm. His father, who had read about 's experiments in Europe and was performing his own experiments, used the newly discovered X-rays and his experimental equipment to examine the broken arm. This is the first recorded surgical use of X-rays in Australia.\nIn 1900, Bragg was a student at , followed by five years at . He went to the University of Adelaide at the age of 16 to study mathematics, chemistry and physics, graduating in 1908. In the same year his father accepted the Cavendish chair of physics at the , and brought the family to England. Bragg entered  in the autumn of 1909 and received a major scholarship in mathematics, despite taking the exam while in bed with . After initially excelling in mathematics, he transferred to the physics course in the later years of his studies, and graduated with first class honours in 1911. In 1914 Bragg was elected to a Fellowship at Trinity College \u2013 a Fellowship at a Cambridge college involves the submission and defence of a thesis.\nAmong Bragg's other interests was ; his personal collection amounted to specimens from some 500 species; all personally collected from South Australia. He discovered a new species of  \u2013 , named for him by .\nThe composition of X-rays was unknown, his father argued that X-rays are streams of particles, others argued that they are waves.  directed an X-ray beam at a crystal in front of a photographic plate; alongside of the spot where the beam struck there were additional spots from deflected rays \u2013 hence X-rays are waves. In 1912, as a first-year research student at Cambridge, W. L. Bragg, while strolling by the river, had the insight that crystals made from parallel sheets of atoms would not diffract X-ray beams that struck their surface at most angles because X-rays deflected by collisions with atoms would be out of phase, cancelling one another out. However, when the X-ray beam stuck at an angle at which the distances it passed between atomic sheets in the crystal equalled the X-ray's wavelength then those deflected would be in phase and produce a spot on a nearby film. From this insight he wrote the simple  that relates the wavelength of the X-ray and the distance between atomic sheets in a simple crystal to the angles at which an impinging X-ray beam would be reflected.\nHis father built an  in which a crystal could be rotated to precise angles while measuring the energy of reflections. This enabled father and son to measure the distances between the atomic sheets in a number of simple crystals. They calculated the spacing of the atoms from the weight of the crystal and the , which enabled them to measure the wavelengths of the X-rays produced by different metallic targets in the X-ray tubes. W. H. Bragg reported their results at meetings and in a paper, giving credit to \"his son\" (unnamed) for the equation, but not as a co-author, which gave his son \"some heartaches\", .\nBragg was commissioned early in  in the  as a  of the . In 1915 he was seconded to the  to develop a method to localise enemy artillery from the boom of their firing. On 2 September 1915 his brother was killed during the . Shortly afterwards, he and his father were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. He was 25 years old and remains the youngest science laureate. The problem with  was that the heavy guns boomed at too low a frequency to be detected by a microphone. After months of frustrating failure he and his group devised a hot wire air wave detector that solved the problem. In this work he was aided by , ,  and Henry Harold Hemming. British sound ranging was very effective; there was a unit in every British Army and their system was adopted by the Americans when they entered the war. For his work during the war he was awarded the  and appointed . He was also  on 16 June 1916, 4 January 1917 and 7 July 1919.\nHot wire sound ranging was used in  during which he served as a civilian adviser.\nBetween the wars, from 1919 to 1937, he worked at the  as  of Physics. He became the director of the  in Teddington in 1937.\nAfter World War II, Bragg returned to Cambridge, splitting the  into research groups. He believed that \"the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants\".\nWhen demobilised he returned to crystallography at Cambridge. They had agreed that father would study organic crystals, son would investigate inorganic compounds. In 1919 when , a long-time family friend, moved to Cambridge, Lawrence Bragg replaced him as Langworthy Professor of Physics at the . He recruited an excellent faculty, including former sound rangers, but he believed that his knowledge of physics was weak and he had no classroom experience. The students, many veterans, were critical and rowdy. He was deeply shaken but with family support he pulled himself together and prevailed. He and R. W. James measured the absolute energy of reflected X-rays, which validated a formula derived by C. G. Darwin before the war. Now they could determine the number of electrons in the reflecting targets, and they were able to decipher the structures of more complicated crystals like silicates. It was still difficult: requiring repeated guessing and retrying. In the late 1920s they eased the analysis by using  on the data.\nIn 1930 he became deeply disturbed while weighing a job offer from Imperial College, London. His family rallied around and he recovered his balance while they spent 1931 in Munich, where he did research.\nHe became director of the  in Teddington in 1937, bringing some co-workers along. However, administration and committees took much of his time away from the workbench.\nRutherford died and the search committee named Lawrence Bragg as next in the line of the  who direct the . The Laboratory had an eminent history in atomic physics and some members were wary of a crystallographer, which Bragg surmounted by even-handed administration. He worked on improving the interpretation of diffraction patterns. In the small crystallography group was a refugee research student without a mentor: . He showed Bragg X-ray diffraction data from , which suggested that the structure of giant biological molecules might be deciphered. Bragg appointed Perutz as his research assistant and within a few months obtained additional support with a grant from the . The work was suspended during the Second World War when Perutz was interned as an enemy alien and then worked in military research.\nDuring the war the Cavendish offered a shortened graduate course which emphasised the electronics needed for . Bragg worked on the structure of metals and consulted on sonar and sound ranging, they still used the Tucker microphone. He became Sir Lawrence in 1941. His father died in 1942, during which Bragg served for six months as Scientific Liaison Officer to Canada. He organised periodic conferences on X-ray analysis, which was widely used in military research.\nAfter the war he led in the formation of the  and was elected its first president. He reorganised the Cavendish into units to reflect his conviction that \"the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants, helped by one or more first-class instrument mechanics and a workshop in which the general run of apparatus can be constructed.\" Senior members of staff now had offices, telephones and secretarial support. The scope of the department was enlarged with a new unit on radio astronomy. His own work focused on the structure of metals, using both X-rays and the . In 1947 he persuaded the  (MRC) to support what he described as the \"gallant attempt\" to determine protein structure as the , initially consisting of Perutz,  and two assistants. Bragg worked with them, by 1960 they had resolved the structure of  to the atomic level. After this he was less involved; their analysis of  was easier after they incorporated two mercury atoms as markers in each molecule. The first monumental triumph of the MRC was decoding the structure of DNA by  and . Bragg announced the discovery at a  on proteins in Belgium on 8 April 1953, it went unreported by the press. He then gave a talk at  in London on Thursday 14 May 1953, which resulted in an article by  in the  of London on Friday 15 May 1953, entitled \"Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life\". Bragg nominated Crick, Watson and  for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; Wilkins' share recognised the contribution of X-ray crystallographers at . Among them was , whose \"\" showed that DNA was a double , not the triple helix that  had proposed. Franklin died before the prize (which only goes to living people) was awarded.\nIn 1953 the Braggs moved into the elegant flat for the Resident Professor in the  in London, the position his father had occupied when he died. In 1934 and 1961 Lawrence had delivered the  and since 1938 he had been Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Institution, delivering an annual lecture. His father's successors had weakened the Institution, so Bragg had to rebuild it. He bolstered finances by enlisting corporate sponsors, the traditional Friday Evening Discourses were followed by a dinner party for the speaker and carefully selected possible patrons, more than 120 of them each year. \"Two of these Discourses in 1965 gave him particular pleasure. On 7 May, Lady Bragg, who had been a member of the Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce (1951\u201355) and was Chairman of the , lectured on 'Changing patterns in marriage and divorce'; and on 15 November, Bragg listened with evident pride to the Discourse on 'Oscillations and noise in jet engines' given by his engineer-son , who was then Chief Scientist at Rolls Royce Ltd and later became Vice-Chancellor of .\" He also introduced a programme of highly regarded Schools' Lectures, enlivened by the elaborate demonstrations that were a hallmark of the Institution. He gave three of these lectures on \"electricity\".\nHe continued research in the Institution by recruiting a small group to work the Davy-Faraday Laboratory in the basement and in the adjoining house, supported by grants he obtained. A visitor to the laboratory succeeded in inserting heavy metals into the enzyme ; the structure of its crystal was solved in 1965 at the Royal Institution by  and his coworkers, with the computations on the 9,040 reflections performed on the digital computer at the University of London, which greatly facilitated the work. Two of the illustrations of the positioning of amino acids in the chain were drawn by Bragg. Unlike myoglobin, in which nearly 80 per cent of the amino-acid residues are in the  conformation, in lysozyme the alpha-helix content is only about 40 per cent of the amino-acid residues found in four main stretches. Other stretches are of the , a conformation that they had proposed earlier. In this conformation, every third peptide is hydrogen-bonded back to the first peptide, thus forming a ring containing ten atoms. They had the complete structure of an enzyme in time for Bragg's 75th birthday. He became Professor Emeritus in 1966.\nX-ray analysis of protein structure flourished in subsequent years, determining the structures of scores of proteins in laboratories around the world. Twenty eight Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work using X-ray analysis. The disadvantage of the method is that it must be done on crystals, which precludes seeing changes in shape when enzymes bind substrates and the like. This problem was solved by the development of another line Bragg had initiated, using modified electron microscopes to image single frozen molecules: .\nIn his long association with the  he was:\nIn 1921 he married Alice Hopkinson (1899\u20131989), a cousin of a friend who had been killed in the war. They had four children, the engineer  (1923\u20132014), David William (1926\u20132005), Margaret Alice, born 1931, (who married the diplomat ) and Patience Mary, born 1935. Alice was on the staff at  until Bragg was appointed director of the National Physical Laboratory in 1937. She was active in a number of public bodies and served as  from 1945-46.\nBragg's hobbies included drawing \u2013 family letters were illustrated with lively sketches \u2013 painting, literature and a lifelong interest in gardening. When he moved to London, he missed having a garden and so worked as a part-time gardener, unrecognised by his employer, until a guest at the house expressed surprise at seeing him there. He died at a hospital near his home at , , Suffolk. He was buried in ; his son David is buried in the  in Cambridge, where Bragg's friend, who had he survived would have been his brother-in-law, Rudolph Cecil Hopkinson is also buried.\nIn August 2013, Bragg's relative, the broadcaster , presented a BBC Radio 4 programme (\"Bragg on the Braggs\") on the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics winners.\nBragg was elected a  \u2013 \"a qualification that makes other ones irrelevant\". He was  by  in the 1941 New Year Honours, and received both the  and the  of the . Although Graeme Hunter, in his book on Bragg , argued that he was more a crystallographer than a physicist, Bragg's lifelong activity showed otherwise\u2014he was more of a physicist than anything else.

It was Florey and Chain who actually made a useful and effective drug out of penicillin, after the task had been abandoned as too difficult.\nFlorey's discoveries, along with the discoveries of Fleming and Ernst Chain, are estimated to have saved over 200 million lives, and he is consequently regarded by the Australian scientific and medical community as one of its greatest figures. , Australia's longest-serving , said, \"In terms of world well-being, Florey was the most important man ever born in Australia.\"\nHoward Florey was born in , a southern suburb of , , the youngest of three children and the only son. His father, Joseph Florey, was an English immigrant, and his mother Bertha Mary Florey was a second-generation Australian.\nFlorey was educated at  Preparatory School (now ) and then , where he excelled in chemistry and physics, but not mathematics. He also played various sports for the school: cricket, football, athletics, and tennis.

His whole face, eyes and scalp were swollen to the extent that he had had an eye removed to relieve the pain. Within a day of being given penicillin, he started to recover. However, the researchers did not have enough penicillin to help him to a full recovery, and he relapsed and died. Because of this experience and the difficulty in producing penicillin, the researchers changed their focus to children, who could be treated with smaller quantities of penicillin.\nFlorey's research team investigated the large-scale production of the mould and efficient extraction of the active ingredient, succeeding to the point where, by 1945, penicillin production was an industrial process for the Allies in World War II. However, Florey said that the project was originally driven by scientific interests, and that the medicinal discovery was a bonus:\nFlorey shared the  in 1945 with Ernst Boris Chain and Alexander Fleming. Fleming first observed the antibiotic properties of the mould that makes penicillin, but it was Chain and Florey who developed it into a useful treatment.\nIn 1958 Florey opened the  at ANU in Canberra.

Throughout his career he played an active role in the development of public policy for the medical sciences in Australia and was a founding member of the  (AAS), and served as its president from 1965 to 1969.\nBurnet's major achievements in microbiology included discovering the causative agents of  and ; developing  for the isolation, culture and detection of ; describing the recombination of influenza ; demonstrating that the  virus does not cause disease in humans. Modern methods for producing  are still based on Burnet's work improving virus growing processes in .\nBurnet was the most highly decorated and honoured scientist to have worked in Australia. For his contributions to Australian science, he was made the first  in 1960, and in 1978 a Knight of the . He was recognised internationally for his achievements: in addition to the Nobel, he received the  and the  and  from the , honorary doctorates, and distinguished service honours from the  and Japan.\nBurnet was born in , ; his father, Frank Burnet, a Scottish emigrant to Australia, was the manager of the Traralgon branch of the Colonial Bank. His mother Hadassah Burnet (n\u00e9e Mackay) was the daughter of a middle-class Scottish immigrant, and met his father when Frank was working in the town of . Frank was 36, and 14 years older than Hadassah. The family was socially conservative Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Frank Macfarlane Burnet was the second of seven children and from childhood was known as \"Mac\". He had an older sister, two younger sisters and three younger brothers. The eldest daughter Doris had a mental disability that consumed most of Hadassah's time and the family saw Doris's condition as an unspoken stigma, discouraging the other children from inviting friends home, lest they come across the eldest daughter. From his early years in Traralgon, Mac enjoyed exploring the environment around him, particularly Traralgon Creek. He first attended a private school run by a single teacher before starting at the government primary school at the age of 7. Mac was distant from his father\u2014who liked to spend his free time fishing and playing golf\u2014from a young age. He preferred bookish pursuits from a young age and was not enamoured of sport, and by the age of eight was old enough to analyse his father's character; Mac disapproved of Frank and saw him as a hypocrite who espoused moral principles and put on a facade of uprightedness, while associating with businessmen of dubious ethics. Hadassah was preoccupied with Doris, so Mac developed a rather solitary personality.\nThe Burnets moved to  in 1909, when Frank was posted to be the bank manager there, having declined a post in London. Burnet was interested in the wildlife around the nearby ; he joined the  in 1910 and enjoyed all outdoor activities. While living in Terang, he began to collect  and study biology. He read biology articles in the , which introduced him to the work of . During his early teens, the family took annual holidays to , where Burnet spent his time observing and recording the behaviour of the wildlife. He was educated at Terang State School and attended Sunday school at the local church, where the priest encouraged him to pursue scholastic studies and awarded him a book on ants as a reward for his academic performance. He advised Frank to invest in Mac's education and he won a full scholarship to board and study at , one of Victoria's most exclusive private schools. Starting there in 1913, Burnet was the only boarder with a full scholarship. He did not enjoy his time there among the scions of the ruling upper class; while most of his peers were brash and sports-oriented, Burnet was bookish and not athletically inclined, and found his fellow students to be arrogant and boorish. During this period he kept his beetle-collecting and disapproval of his peers a secret and mixed with his schoolmates out of necessity. Nevertheless, his academic prowess gained him privileges, and he graduated in 1916, placing first in his school overall, and in history, English, chemistry and physics. The typical university path for a person of his social background was to pursue studies in theology, law or medicine. By this time, he was becoming disillusioned with religion and chose medicine. Due to World War I, military service was a possibility and he felt that a medical background would increase his chances of being given a non-combat post.\nFrom 1918, Burnet attended the , where he lived in  on a residential scholarship. There, he read more of Darwin's work and was influenced by the ideas of science and society in the writings of . He enjoyed his time at university and spent much of his free time reading biology books in the library to feed his passion for scientific knowledge. He also had fleeting sporting success, holding down a position in Ormond's First VIII rowing squad for a brief period. He continued to pursue his study of beetles in private, although his classmates found out and there was no loss in this as they viewed his hobby positively. Despite an ongoing shyness, Burnet got on well with staff and students at university. Burnet was self-motivated and often skipped lectures to study at his own faster pace and pursue further knowledge in the library, and he came equal first in physics and chemistry in first year. The following year, 1918, he became increasingly immersed in laboratory work, but he was also dogged by peer pressure to enlist in the , which he saw as a distasteful prospect. However, this was averted by the end of the . In 1919, he was one of 12 high-performing students selected for extra tuition, and he came equal first in third year physiology. He began clinical work in the same year, but found it somewhat unpleasant as he was interested in diagnosing the patient and had little interest in showing empathy towards them.\nWhile at university, he became an  and later an aggressive atheist; he was sceptical of religious faith, which he regarded as \"an effort to believe what common sense tells you isn't true.\" He was also disgusted by what he regarded as hypocritical conduct by religious adherents. Towards the later years of his undergraduate years, his unhappiness with religion began to dog him to a greater extent. He tried to become involved with  for a brief period but then resolved to devote himself to scientific research. The length of time required to study medicine had been reduced to five years to train doctors faster following the outbreak of , and Burnet graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and a Bachelor of Surgery in 1922, ranking second in the final exams despite the death of his father a few weeks earlier. His fellow graduates included , , , Rupert Willis and , who became distinguished scientists in their own right.\nHe then did a ten-month residency at  to gain experience before going into practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under  and , both well known surgeons. He enjoyed this period immensely and was disappointed when he had to do his medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist , whom Burnet came to idolise. As a result of this he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the  was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, who was in charge of such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more suited to a laboratory research career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. Burnet complied.\nDuring the transition period he worked as a pathology registrar at the  and also prepared for his Doctor of Medicine examinations, late in 1923. In 1923 he took up the post of senior resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital; the laboratories were a part of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He conducted research into the  reactions in , leading to his first scientific publications. He decided to work full-time on the  response in , even though he was technically supposed to pursuing  as part of his obligations to the hospital. Burnet came first in the Doctor of Medicine exams by a long distance, and his score was excluded from the scaling process so that the other students would not fail for being so far behind.\nAt the time, the Hall Institute was in the early stages of rapid expansion. The new director of the Institute, , wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in ,  and  that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to Burnet and saw him as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on  in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the  at the  in . Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was free to do his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if  was affected by .\nHe was awarded the  by the Lister Institute in 1926; this gave him enough money for him to resign his curator position and he began full-time research on bacteriophages. He injected mice with bacteriophage and observed their immunological reactions and believed bacteriophages to be . For this work he received a Ph.D. from the  in 1928 under the direction of Professor  and was invited to write a chapter on bacteriophages for the  . He was also given an invitation to deliver a paper at the  in 1927 on the link between O-agglutinins and bacteriophage. Burnet began attending the  functions and befriended some communists, although he refrained from joining them in overt left-wing activism. He also spent his free time enjoying theatre, engaging in amateur  and cycling through continental Europe.\nWhile in London, Burnet became engaged to fellow Australian Edith Linda Marston Druce. She was a secondary school teacher and daughter of a barrister's clerk and the pair had met in 1923 and had a few dates but did not keep in touch. Druce sought out Burnet while on a holiday in London and they quickly agreed to marriage although she had to return to Australia. They married in 1928 after he had completed his Ph.D. and returned to Australia, and had a son and two daughters. At the time, there was a vacancy for the Chair of Bacteriology at the University of London, and Ledingham was lobbying his colleagues to offer Burnet the post, but Burnet returned to Australia, partly because of Druce.\nWhen Burnet returned to Australia, he went back to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, where he was appointed assistant director by Kellaway. His first assignment was to investigate the \"Bundaberg disaster\", in which 12 children had died after receiving a contaminated  vaccine. Kellaway was put in charge of a  to investigate the matter and he put Burnet in charge of the laboratory investigations. He identified  in the toxin- mixture that had been administered to the children; it had been picked up from the skin of one of the children and then transmitted to the others in the injections. However, it turned out to be another toxin that had caused the children's deaths; this work on staphylococcal toxin piqued his interest in immunology. During this time, he continued to study bacteriophages, writing 32 papers on phages between 1924 and 1937. In 1929, Burnet and his graduate assistant Margot McKie wrote a paper suggesting that bacteriophages could exist as a stable non-infectious form that multiplies with the bacterial host. Their pioneering description of  was not accepted until much later, and was crucial to the work of ,  and  on the replication mechanism and genetics of viruses, for which they were awarded the 1969 .\nBetween 1932 and 1933, Burnet took leave of absence to undertake a fellowship at the  in London. The Great Depression had resulted in Burnet's salary being cut from 1000 to 750 pounds, and the National Institute had been given a large grant from the  that allowed them to hire Burnet at 1000 pounds per annum. The National Institute's Director Sir  gained permission from Kellaway for the two-year move; Kellaway promised to hold Burnet's job for him when he returned and felt that the experience would make Burnet\u2014whom he saw as the Hall Institute's brightest young scientist\u2014better equipped to expand operations when he returned to Melbourne. Dale also paid for Burnet's sister to travel to England to help look after her brother's young children.\nSignificant breakthroughs in virology were made while he was there, including the isolation and first demonstration of the transmission of the  virus. His own research was on the , which he used in developing a chick embryo assay for the isolation and quantification of animal viruses. Dale offered Burnet a permanent position but he declined and returned to the Hall Institute. Following his productive work in London, the Rockefeller Institute agreed to fund a new virus research laboratory in Melbourne for Burnet. He brought back a set of viruses from the National Institute to begin the basis of research in Melbourne.\nWhen Burnet returned to Australia, he continued his work on virology, including the  of . He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of  and . After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban in order to prevent human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist , the causative organism of which was named  in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of herpes and Q fever displayed an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his scientific method.\nDuring World War II, Burnet's research moved to  and . With the outbreak of war, Burnet was handed more responsibility and made acting director and had to oversee the move into a new building as Kellaway was seconded to the military in 1939. Due to Kellaway, many of the infectious disease problems afflicting the military were referred to the Institute. Fearing a repeat of the massive global influenza outbreak that occurred after World War I, Burnet focused the Institute in the search for a vaccine. He first tested the vaccine on a group of medical students, and after a promising test on 107 army volunteers in February 1942 following a rise in infections, a large-scale program was introduced two months later to inoculate all new recruits after an influenza A outbreak. In this trial, 20,000 personnel were vaccinated, without success, and the scheme was abandoned. In 1942, the investigations into scrub typhus accelerated after an exodus of researchers in that field from  after the  conquest of the area. However, this ended in tragedy when his collaborator  accidentally injected herself and then died of the infection. Nevertheless, his work on immunisation had earned him international recognition by this time.\nBurnet's first book, , was published in 1940. It had wide influence and was translated into several languages. In 1942 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1944 he travelled to  to deliver the Dunham Lectures. There he was offered a chair, but he refused and returned to Australia. This was attributed to his nationalistic tendencies, as well as his sense of loyalty to the Hall Institute. During his trip he also visited the US military facility at , where he discussed his work on influenza with the scientists working there.\nIn 1944, he was appointed director of the Institute when Kellaway was appointed director of the . Although Kellaway had groomed Burnet to become a pivotal figure, he was hesitant as to whether Burnet would be at his most effective with a strategic leadership role. Kellaway thought that Burnet might not be suited to the post, and should have continued to focus purely on research for the time being. Burnet had similar doubts, particularly given his taciturn nature, but applied for the position anyway. Although he was not known for his social skills, his ability as a scientist and to impart ideas for investigation to his subordinates held his leadership and the Institute in good stead. Unlike his predecessor, who valued a broad gamut of research activities, Burnet was of the opinion that the Institute could not make a significant impact at global level in this way, and he pursued a policy of focusing all effort into one area at a time. Always a strong-willed and rather isolated man, he became more single-minded and less tolerant of criticism of his work and expected a more hierarchical structure and unquestioning obedience. According to biographer Sexton, he \"displayed a kind of territorial protectiveness in relation to his own work\".\nIn 1944, it was decided by the University of Melbourne that Burnet would be appointed a professor as part of a cooperative program so that university students could be experimentally trained at the Institute, while the researchers engaged in some teaching. This was not a success, and there was much tension, as Burnet repeatedly expressed his opinion in public that university teaching and research should be kept separate, at one point leading to a series of open letters from university professors decrying his attitude. Burnet was also not interested in the politics of university funding, and his disengagement from administrative matters engendered resentment. On the other hand, Burnet was vigorous in obtaining funding for the Hall Institute from government bodies, resorting to the bluff of feigning interest in moving overseas to secure continued strong backing. However, he was criticised for being thrifty and refusing to invest in cutting edge equipment, despite the Hall Institute's high standing in research circles. Colleagues believed that he was sceptical of modern technology and thought his outlook to be limiting.\nIn 1946, he initiated the Clinical Research Unit to allow for closer cooperation with the clinical activities of the now named . Despite his known derisive views of clinical science as being inferior, he supported the work enthusiastically.\nUnder Burnet's direction, scientists at the Institute made significant contributions to infectious disease research during a period that has been called the \"golden age of virology\". Virologists including , , , , and  made significant contributions on , , , , herpes and influenza.\nBurnet made significant contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including  assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the  that is secreted by , which later provided the foundation for  significant work on  and the neuraminidase substrate, . Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.\nIn 1957, Burnet decided that research at the Institute should focus on immunology. Burnet reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned and feeling the action was arrogant; for Burnet's part he was comfortable with the decision as he thought it to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the 's . After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on immunological problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to  and the  reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of immunology, immunological surveillance and cancer.\nAt the time, immunology was becoming more sophisticated, with the increasing role of  and . Burnet was suspicious of the direction in which immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude was a factor in his decision to turn the Institute's focus to immunology.\nBurnet began to switch his focus to immunology in the 1940s. In 1941 he wrote a  called \"The Production of Antibodies\", which was revised and reissued in 1949 with Frank Fenner as a co-author. This book is seen as a key publication in immunology\u2014it marks the move from the study of immunology as a chemical endeavour to a biological one. Importantly in this work, he introduced the concept of \"self\" and \"non-self\" to immunology. The distinction between self and non-self was an integral part of Burnet's biological outlook, of his interest in the living organism in its totality, its activities, and interactions. Burnet regarded the \"self\" of the host body as being actively defined during its embryogenesis through complex interactions between immune cells and all the other cells and molecules within an embryo.\nUsing the concept of self, Burnet introduced a hypothesis about the situation where the body failed to make antibodies to its own components () and by extension the idea of . He proposed that\nBurnet was, however, unable to prove this experimentally. ,  and  did find support for Burnet's hypothesis in 1953 when they showed that  could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not from any other mouse strain. Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet and Medawar were able to coordinate their work effectively despite their rather different personalities and physical separation; Burnet was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.\nHowever, later studies showed that cells or tissues transplanted before the immune system development of the recipient, such as in embryonic recipients, could be treated as foreign and trigger rejection, countering Burnet's explanation for self tolerance. In contrast to the Burnet hypothesis of a special tolerance-inducing period defined by the age of the animal,  proposed in 1959, that it is the age of the lymphocyte that defines whether an antigen that is encountered will induce tolerance, with immature lymphocytes being tolerance-sensitive. Lederberg's concept is now known as central tolerance, and is widely accepted. It may also explain the success of some transplants given early in life and the failure to induce tolerance in other studies. Burnet noted that his contributions to immune tolerance were strictly theoretical:\nBurnet was interested in how the body produces antibodies in response to antigens. The dominant idea in the literature through the 1940s was that the antigen acted as a template for antibody production, which was known as the \"instructive\" hypothesis. Burnet was not satisfied with this explanation, and in the second edition of \"The Production of Antibodies\", he and Fenner advanced an indirect template theory which proposed that each antigen could influence the genome, thus effecting the production of antibodies. In 1956 he became interested in 's natural selection hypothesis, which described a mechanism for immune response based on an earlier theory of Nobel-winning immunologist . Jerne proposed that the antigen bound to an antibody by chance and, that upon binding, more antibodies to that antigen would be produced. Burnet developed a model which he named  that expanded on and improved Jerne's hypothesis. Burnet proposed that each  bears on its surface specific immunoglobulins reflecting the specificity of the antibody that will later be synthesised once the cell is activated by an antigen. The antigen serves as a selective stimulus, causing preferential proliferation and differentiation of\nthe clones that have receptors for that antigen.\nIn 1958  and Lederberg showed that one  always produces only one antibody, which was the first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book . His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and  as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.\nThere is some contention over Burnet's publication of his version of the theory in the  in 1957. Some commentators argue he published in an Australian journal to fast-track his hypothesis and obtain priority for his theory over ideas that were published later that year in a paper written by , which Burnet had read prior to its publication. In his paper Burnet cited Talmage's review, and in a later interview, Talmage said he believed that Burnet \"truthfully had developed the idea before he received my paper\". The theory is now sometimes known as Burnet's clonal selection theory, which overlooks the contributions of Ehrlich, Jerne, Talmage, and the contributions of Lederberg, who conceptualised the genetics of clonal selection.\nBurnet's work on graft-versus-host was in collaboration with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this was known as the Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain  in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune . They looked at the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug  to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human autoimmune disease.\nIn 1960, Burnet scaled back his laboratory work, taking one day off per week to concentrate on writing. In 1963, , which he authored with , was published. He also oversaw an expansion of the Hall Institute and secured funding from the  and the state government to build two further floors in the building and take over some of the space taken up by the pathology department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Despite this, Burnet believed that a world class research body needed to be small enough that one person could effectively run it, and maintained tight control over its activities throughout his leadership. He determined the policies himself, and personally selected all of the research staff and students, relying on a small staff to enforce his plans.\nHe continued to be active in the laboratory until his retirement in 1965, although his experimental time began to decrease as the operations became increasingly focused on immunology; Burnet's work in this area had been mostly theoretical. Gustav Nossal became the next director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. Under Burnet's leadership the Institute had become \"probably the world's best known research centre devoted to the study of immunology.\" However, with the increasing sophistication in medical science and its reliance on more complicated technology, Burnet's lone-wolf approach became less compatible with the research environment, which required more collaboration. In his final years at the helm, Burnet allowed more technical modernisation during the transition period to Nossal's leadership.\nFrom 1937 Burnet was involved in a variety of scientific and public policy bodies, starting with a position on a government advisory council on polio. After he became the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1944, he was considered a public figure and overcame shyness to become a good public speaker. He recognised the importance of co-operation with the media if the general public was to understand science and scientists, and his writings and lectures played an important part in the formulation of public attitudes and policy in Australia on a variety of biological topics. However, despite making many appearances on radio and television, he never became at ease with interviews and had to be selective with outreach engagements due to the many invitations he received, and tended to accept those that had the potential to promote the Institute. Over time, he began to increase his activism, as he felt more confident that he would be able to make an impact as his reputation grew, especially after winning the Nobel Prize, and even more so after his retirement from the directorship of the Institute. Although Burnet was not naturally outgoing, he saw it as the social responsibility of a scientific leader and scholar to publicly speak out and impart wisdom and foresight to the wider community.\nBurnet served as a member or chairman of scientific committees, both in Australia and overseas. Between 1947 and 1953, he was a member of the 's Medical Research Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for medical research in Australia. During this same period (1947\u201352), he was also a member of the  Defence Research and Development Policy Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that Burnet made the recommendation that Australia pursue development of  and  to target neighbouring countries' food stocks and spread infectious diseases. His report was titled . Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; he was concerned that Australians were being exposed to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.\nInternationally, Burnet was a chairman of the Papua New Guinea Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1962 and 1969. At the time, Papua New Guinea was an Australian territory, and Burnet had first travelled there as his son was posted there. His role on the committee allowed him to explore his interest in . He was particularly interested in  (laughing sickness), and lobbied the Australian government to establish the Papua New Guinea Institute of Human Biology. Burnet later helped oversee the institute's contribution to the Anglo-Australian participation in the International Biological Programme in the Field of Human Adaptability.\nBurnet served as first chair for the  (1966\u201369), a Commonwealth initiative to foster interaction between the member countries' elite, and he was also active in the , serving on the Expert Advisory Panels on Virus Diseases and on Immunology between 1952 and 1969 and the World Health Organization Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1969 and 1973.\nIn 1964, he was appointed to sit on the University Council of Victoria's third university  on an interim basis until the institution was formed in 1966. He served until 1970. He advocated a less hierarchical relationship between a professor and student, something seen as a move away from the English tradition prevalent in Australia towards an American model. He also called for the downgrading of the importance placed on the liberal arts. His ideas were too radical for his peers and he stepped down from the role in 1970 after none of his suggestions had made an impact.\nBurnet was opposed to the use of nuclear power in Australia owing to the issues of . He later retracted his objections to , feeling that nuclear power was necessary while other renewable energy sources were being developed. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he was also vocal in the anti-smoking movement; he was one of the first high-profile figures in Australia to educate the public on the dangers of tobacco, and he appeared in a television advertisement criticising the ethics of , and broadcasters for displaying such material. He and fellow activists were surprised that the commercial was allowed to run briefly, before being taken off air by the station, which only further generated attention for the anti-smoking campaign. A former smoker, he had rejected the habit in the 1950s after several friends died. Burnet was also a critic of the  and called for the creation of an international police force.\nFollowing his resignation from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an office at the  in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books on a variety of topics including immunology, ageing and cancer, and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled , which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He was known for his ability to write quickly, often without a final draft, and his ability to convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had much influence. In 1969 he published , considered his magnum opus on immunity, which attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the clonal selection theory. The following year, he wrote , which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused work schedule, often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.\nHe became president of the  in 1965, having been a foundational fellow when the Academy was formed in 1954. He had been offered the presidency in 1958 to replace the inaugural head Sir , but declined, although he served on the council and as vice president in 1961\u201363. As president he was recognised by both government and the public as the leading scientist in Australia. His stature as a scientist gave him the gravitas to end policy disputes, and gave the Academy and its advocacy more credibility in the eyes of government and industry. As such his term was considered to be highly successful. Oliphant said that Burnet's personal prestige was very important in the increased respect the AAS won and that he \"made the biological sciences far more acceptable in Australia\".\nHe helped establish the Academy's Science and Industry Forum, which was formed in the second year of his leadership in order to improve dialogue between researchers and industrialists. It investigated whether a national science policy should be formulated and led to the eventual creation of the . He also laid the foundations of the . When his presidency ended in 1969, the Academy founded the , which is the Academy's highest award for biological sciences.\nAs in many of his previous pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group of the scientific community and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful due to a lack of concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members\u2014such as Burnet\u2014being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.\nIn 1966, Burnet accepted a nomination from Australia Prime Minister Sir  to become the inaugural chairman of the , a body that aimed to increase the professional interchange between the various nations of the . Burnet served in the role for three years and helped start it on a path of steady growth, although he was unable to use it as a personal platform to  espouse the importance of human biology.\nBurnet's essays and books published in his later life caused contention within the scientific community and to the chagrin of his peers Burnet often made pessimistic proclamations about the future of science. In 1966 Burnet wrote an opinion article for  entitled \"Men or Molecules?\" in which he questioned the usefulness of , arguing that it had not and would not contribute anything of use to medicine and that manipulation of the genome as had been demonstrated in bacteria would do more harm to humans than good. Gustav Nossal subsequently described Burnet as \"a biologist with a love-hate affair with biochemistry, which led to a brief but damaging rejection of the worth of molecular biology.\"\nHe delivered the inaugural Oscar Mendelsohn lecture in 1971 at  and advocated policies for Australia such as population control, prevention of war, long-term plans for the management of the environment and natural resources, Aboriginal land rights, socialism, recycling, advertising bans on socially harmful products, and more regulation of the environment. He angrily denounced French nuclear testing in the Pacific, and after consistently voting for the ruling Liberal Party coalition as it ruled for the past few decades, signed an open letter backing the opposition Labor Party of , which took power in 1972. However, he soon spoke out against Whitlam's lack of action against tobacco advertising and French nuclear tests. Burnet often found himself frustrated with the refusal of politicians to base policy on long-term objectives, such as the sustainability of human life.\nIn 1971\u201372, he wrote four books, most notably, , which caused great controversy due to its strident attacks on molecular biology, cellular biology, and claims that cancer and various other diseases were incurable and that it was pointless to try to do so. He also predicted that scientific progress would end soon.\nBurnet spoke and wrote widely on the topic of human biology after his retirement, aiming to reach all strata of society. He courted the media as well as the scientific community, often leading to sensationalist or scientifically unrigorous report of his outspoken views. This often angered colleagues, who viewed him as abusing his stature to deliberately cause a stir.  In 1966 Burnet presented the , focusing on human biology. He provided a conceptual framework for sustainable development; 21 years later the definition provided by the  was almost identical. In 1970 he revised an earlier book which was published as ; it was followed by , which was published in 1978. The books discuss aspects of human biology, a topic which Burnet wrote on extensively in his later years. In  he argued that the roots of all human behaviour can be found in the behaviour of animals; in  he addressed issues of ageing, life, death and the future of mankind. The books strongly polarised the scientific community, and one reviewer described his ideas of sociobiology as \"extreme\" and giving \"a dismal, unappealing view of humanity\". In , he also called for society to accept euthanasia of ill older people, repeat violent criminals, and most controversially, abortion of pregnancies likely to result in disabled children, and infanticide of handicapped newborns. Knowing that there would be a strong backlash for such policies, he departed overseas for a two-month lecture series at the time of the book launch. In his absence, he was strongly assailed in newspaper letters and some correspondents compared his stance on infanticide to that of . At the same time, he also changed his stance on nuclear power and advocated its use, and the reinvestment of revenue for research into solar power. This about face angered the environmental movement.\nHis first wife, Edith Linda Druce, died from lymphoid leukaemia in 1973, after a four-year struggle. During her final years, Burnet refused all offers of lectures overseas to spend more time nursing his ailing wife. For a period after this he became very lethargic and reclusive, numbed by his wife's death. He then moved into Ormond College for company, and resumed beetle collecting, but for a year after her death, Burnet tried to alleviate his grief by writing mock letters to her once a week. Gradually he regained his enthusiasm and began writing again. In 1975, he travelled to California to deliver a series of lectures. In 1976 he married Hazel G. Jenkins, a widowed former singer from a business family in her 70s who was working in the microbiology department as a librarian, and moved out of Ormond College.\nIn 1978 Burnet decided to officially retire; in retirement he wrote two books. During this time, he missed his laboratory work, and he was constrained to social events and theorising. In 1982, Burnet was one of three contributors to , writing about genetic issues and their impact on the nation's impact. As a result of the success of the book, in early 1983, Burnet was appointed to the 70-person Australian Advisory Council of Elders to offer counsel to policymakers, but the group folded after several members became too frail or died.\nBurnet continued to travel and speak, but in the early 1980s, he and his wife became increasingly hampered by illness. Having surmised his illness two years earlier, in November 1984 he underwent surgery for . He made plans to resume scientific meetings, but was then taken ill again, with significant pain in his thorax and legs. Secondary lesions were found in June 1985 and declared to be inoperable and terminal. A supporter of euthanasia, Burnet was unfazed by his imminent death, and he died on 31 August at his son's home at  after two months' of illness. He was given a state funeral by the government of Australia; many of his distinguished colleagues from the Hall Institute such as Nossal and Fenner were pall-bearers, and he was buried near his paternal grandparents after a private family service at  in Koroit, near Port Fairy. Following his death he was honoured by the ; Prime Minister  took the highly unusual step of moving a condolence motion, an honour typically reserved for parliamentarians. Lady Hazel Burnet died in 1990.\nBurnet received extensive honours for his contributions to science and public life during his lifetime. He was  in the , received the Elizabeth II Coronation Medal in 1953, and was appointed to the  (OM) in the 1958 . In 1960 he was the first recipient of the honorary  award. He received a Gold and Silver Star from the Japanese  in 1961.  He was appointed  (KBE) in the , and received the Elizabeth II Jubilee Medal in 1977. In 1978 he was made a  (AK). He was only the fourth person to receive this honour.\nHe was a fellow or honorary member of 30 international Academies of Sciences. He received 10 honorary  degrees from universities including Cambridge, Harvard and Oxford, an honorary  degree from Hahnemann Medical College (now part of ), an honorary Doctor of Medical Science from the  and a  degree from the University of Melbourne. Including his Nobel, he received 19 medals or awards including the  and the  from the Royal Society and the ; he also received 33 international lectureships and 17 lectureships within Australia.\nAfter his death, Australia's largest communicable diseases research institute\u2014the  was renamed in his honour. The Burnet Clinical Research Unit of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute was also named in his honour in 1986. In 1975 his work on immunology was recognised by a 33-cent stamp released by . Seven Australian medical scientists were commemorated in the issue of a set of four Australian stamps released in 1995; he appears on the 45-cent stamp with fellow University of Melbourne graduate . He also appears on a  stamp that was issued in 1997. The centenary of his birth was celebrated in Australia in 1999; a statue of him was erected in Franklin Street, Traralgon; and several events were held in his honour including the release of a new edition of  by Oxford University Press.\nBurnet biographer Christopher Sexton suggests that Burnet's legacy is fourfold: (1) the scope and quality of his research; (2) his nationalistic attitude which led him to stay in Australia, leading to the development of science in Australia and inspiring future generations of Australian scientists; (3) his success establishing the reputation of Australian medical research worldwide; and (4) his books, essays and other writings. In spite of his sometimes controversial ideas on science and humanity,  has noted that \"Burnet's reputation is secure in his achievements as an experimentalist, a theoretician and a leader of the Australian scientific community.\"\n\n\n"},

He shared the prize with  and .\nEccles was born in , Australia. He grew up there with his two sisters and his parents: William and Mary Carew Eccles (both teachers, who  him until he was 12). He initially attended Warrnambool High School (now ) (where a science wing is named in his honour), then completed his final year of schooling at . Aged 17, he was awarded a senior scholarship to study medicine at the . As a medical undergraduate, he was never able to find a satisfactory explanation for the interaction of mind and body; he started to think about becoming a neuroscientist. He graduated (with first class honours) in 1925, and was awarded a  to study under  at , , where he received his Doctor of Philosophy in 1929.\nIn 1937 Eccles returned to Australia, where he worked on military research during . During this time Eccles was the director of Kanematsu Institute at , he and  gave research lectures at the , strongly influencing its intellectual environment. After the war, he became a professor at the  in New Zealand. From 1952 to 1962 he worked as a professor at the  (JCSMR) of the . The Eccles Institute of Neuroscience is headquartered in a new wing of the JCSMR building, constructed with the assistance of a $63M grant from the Commonwealth Government and completed in March 2012.\nIn the early 1950s, Eccles and his colleagues performed the research that would lead to his receiving the Nobel Prize. To study synapses in the peripheral nervous system, Eccles and colleagues used the stretch reflex as a model, which is easily studied because it consists of only two : a sensory neuron (the  fibre) and the . The sensory neuron synapses onto the motor neuron in the . When a current is passed into the sensory neuron in the , the motor neuron innervating the quadriceps produced a small  (EPSP). When a similar current is passed through the , the opposing muscle to the quadriceps, an  (IPSP) is produced in the quadriceps motor neuron. Although a single EPSP was not enough to fire an  in the motor neuron, the sum of several EPSPs from multiple sensory neurons synapsing onto the motor neuron can cause the motor neuron to fire, thus contracting the quadriceps. On the other hand, IPSPs could subtract from this sum of EPSPs, preventing the motor neuron from firing.\nApart from these seminal experiments, Eccles was key to a number of important developments in . Until around 1949, Eccles believed that  was primarily electrical rather than chemical. Although he was wrong in this hypothesis, his arguments led him and others to perform some of the experiments which proved chemical synaptic transmission.  and Eccles worked together on some of the experiments which elucidated the role of  as a  in the brain.\nHe was appointed a  in 1958 in recognition of services to physiological research.\nHe won the  Award in 1963, the same year he won the Nobel Prize.\nIn 1964 he became an honorary member to the , and in 1966 he moved to the United States to work at the  in Chicago. Unhappy with the working conditions there, he left to become a professor at the  from 1968 until he retired in 1975. After retirement, he moved to Switzerland and wrote on the .\nIn 1981, Eccles became a founding member of the .\nIn 1990 he was appointed a  of the  (AC) in recognition of service to science, particularly in the field of neurophysiology. He died in 1997 in , , Switzerland.\nIn  (1973), Eccles summarises his philosophy: \"Now before discussing brain function in detail I will at the beginning give an account of my philosophical position on the so-called 'brain-mind problem' so that you will be able to relate the experimental evidence to this philosophical position. I have written at length on this philosophy in my book . In Fig. 6-1 you will be able to see that I fully accept the recent philosophical achievements of  with his concept of three worlds. I was a , now I am a ! Cartesian dualism has become unfashionable with many people. They embrace  to escape the enigma of brain-mind interaction with its perplexing problems. But Sir Karl Popper and I are , and what is more, ! The three worlds are very easily defined. I believe that in the classification of Fig. 6-1 there is nothing left out. It takes care of everything that is in existence and in our experience. All can be classified in one or other of the categories enumerated under Worlds 1, 2 and 3.\n\n\"In Fig. 6-1, World 1 is the world of physical objects and states. It comprises the whole cosmos of matter and energy, all of biology including human brains, and all artifacts that man has made for coding information, as for example, the paper and ink of books or the material base of works of art. World 1 is the total world of the materialists. They recognise nothing else. All else is fantasy.\n\"World 2 is the world of states of consciousness and subjective knowledge of all kinds. The totality of our perceptions comes in this world. But there are several levels. In agreement with Polten, I tend to recognise three kinds of levels of World 2, as indicated in Fig. 6-2, but it may be more correct to think of it as a spectrum.\nFIG. 6-2, World of Consciousness\n\"The first level (outer sense) would be the ordinary perceptions provided by all our sense organs, hearing and touch and sight and smell and pain. All of these perceptions are in World 2, of course: vision with light and colour; sound with music and harmony; touch with all its qualities and vibration; the range of odours and tastes, and so on. These qualities do not exist in World 1, where correspondingly there are but electromagnetic waves, pressure waves in the atmosphere, material objects, and chemical substances.\n\"In addition there is a level of , which is the world of more subtle perceptions. It is the world of your emotions, of your feelings of joy and sadness and fear and anger and so on. It includes all your memory, and all your imaginings and planning into the future. In fact there is a whole range of levels which could be described at length. All the subtle experiences of the human person are in this inner sensory world. It is all private to you but you can reveal it in linguistic expression, and by gestures of all levels of subtlety.\n\"Finally, at the core of World 2 there is the  or , which is the basis of our unity as an experiencing being throughout our whole lifetime.\n\"This World 2 is our . Our conscious experiences are the basis of our knowledge of World 1, which is thus a world of , a derivative world. Whenever I am doing a scientific experiment, for example, I have to plan it cognitively, all in my thoughts, and then consciously carry out my plan of action in the experiment. Finally I have to look at the results and evaluate them in thought. For example, I have to see the traces of the oscilloscope and their photographic records or hear the signals on the loudspeaker. The various signals from the recording equipment have to be received by my sense organs, transmitted to my brain, and so to my consciousness, then appropriately measured and compared before I can begin to think about the significance of the experimental results. We are all the time, in every action we do, incessantly playing backwards and forwards between World 1 and World 2.\n\"And what is World 3? As shown in Fig. 6-1 it is the whole world of culture. It is the world that was created by man and that reciprocally made man. This is my message in which I follow Popper unreservedly. The whole of language is here. All our means of communication, all our intellectual efforts coded in books, coded in the artistic and technological treasures in the museums, coded in every artefact left by man from primitive times\u2014this is World 3 right up to the present time. It is the world of civilisation and culture. Education is the means whereby each human being is brought into relation with World 3. In this manner he becomes immersed in it throughout life, participating in the heritage of mankind and so becoming fully human. World 3 is the world that uniquely relates to man. It is the world which is completely unknown to animals. They are blind to all of World 3. I say that without any reservations. This is then the first part of my story.\n\"Now I come to consider the way in which the three worlds interact...\"\nDespite these words, in his late book , Eccles proposed a dualistic mechanism of mind.\nEccles had nine children. Eccles married Irene Miller Eccles (1904-2002) in 1928 and divorced in 1968. After his divorce in 1968, Eccles married Helena T\u00e1bor\u00edkov\u00e1; a fellow neuropsychologist and M.D. of Charles University. The two often collaborated in research and they remained married until his death. Eccles died on 2 May 1997 in his home of . He was buried in Contra, Switzerland.\n"},

In 1973 he was awarded the , \"for an epic and psychological narrative art which has introduced a new continent into literature\", as it says in the Swedish Academy's citation, the only Australian to have been awarded the prize. White was also the inaugural recipient of the .\nWhite was born in , London, to Victor Martindale White and Ruth (n\u00e9e Withycombe), both Australians, in their apartment overlooking  on 28 May 1912. His family returned to Sydney, Australia, when he was six months old. As a child he lived in a flat with his sister, a nanny, and a maid while his parents lived in an adjoining flat.  In 1916 they moved to a house in  that many years later became a nursing home, Lulworth House, the residents of which included , , and White's partner .\nAt the age of four, White developed asthma, a condition that had taken the life of his maternal grandfather. White's health was fragile throughout his childhood, which precluded his participation in many childhood activities.\nHe loved the theatre, which he first visited at an early age (his mother took him to see  at the age of six). This love was expressed at home when he performed private rites in the garden and danced for his mother's friends.\nAt the age of five, he attended kindergarten at Sandtoft in , in Sydney's .\nAt the age of ten, White was sent to , a boarding school in  in the  of New South Wales, in an attempt to abate his asthma. It took him some time to adjust to the presence of other children. At boarding school, he started to write plays. Even at this early age, White wrote about palpably adult themes. In 1924, the boarding school ran into financial trouble, and the headmaster suggested for White to be sent to a  in England, a suggestion that his parents accepted.\nWhite struggled to adjust to his new surroundings at , England. He later described it as \"a four-year prison sentence\". White withdrew socially and had a limited circle of acquaintances. Occasionally, he would holiday with his parents at European locations, but their relationship remained distant. However he did spend time with his cousin Jack Withycombe during this period, and Jack's daughter  became a mentor to him while he was writing his first book of poems,  between the years 1927\u201329.\nWhile at school in London, White made one close friend, Ronald Waterall, an older boy who shared similar interests. White's biographer, , wrote that \"the two men would walk, arm-in-arm, to London shows; and stand around stage doors crumbing for a glimpse of their favourite stars, giving a practical demonstration of a chorus girl's high kick... with appropriate vocal accompaniment\". When Waterall left school, White withdrew again. He asked his parents if he could leave school to become an actor. The parents compromised and allowed him to finish school early if he came home to Australia to try life on the land. His parents felt that he should work on the land rather than become a writer and hoped that his work as a  would temper his artistic ambitions.\nWhite spent two years working as a  at Bolaro, a 73-square-kilometre (28\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) station near , on the edge of the , in southeastern Australia. Although he grew to respect the land and his health improved, it was clear that he was not cut out for this life.\nFrom 1932 to 1935, White lived in England, studying French and German literature at , . During his time at Cambridge he developed a romantic attraction to a young man who had come to King's College to become an Anglican priest. White dared not speak of his feelings for fear of losing the friendship and, like many other gay men of that period, he feared that his sexuality would doom him to a lonely life. Then, one night, the student priest, after an awkward liaison with two women, admitted to White that women meant nothing to him sexually. That became White's first love affair.\nDuring White's time at Cambridge he published a collection of poetry entitled , and wrote a play named , which was later performed by an amateur group (which included his sister Suzanne) at the tiny  in Sydney. After being admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1935, White briefly settled in London, where he lived in an area that was frequented by artists. There, the young author thrived creatively for a time, writing several unpublished works and reworking , a novel that he had written while jackarooing. In 1937, White's father died, leaving him ten thousand pounds in inheritance. The fortune enabled him to write full-time in relative comfort. Two more plays followed before he succeeded in finding a publisher for . The novel was received well in London but poorly in Australia. He began writing another novel, , but abandoned it before its completion after receiving negative comments, a decision that he later admitted regretting.\nIn 1936, White met the painter , 18 years his senior, who became an important influence in his life and work. The two men never became lovers but remained firm friends. In White's own words, \"He became what I most needed, an intellectual and aesthetic mentor\". They had many similarities: they were both gay and they both felt like outsiders in their own families; as a result they both had ambivalent feelings about their families and backgrounds, yet both maintained close and lifelong links with their families, particularly their mothers. They also both appreciated the benefits of social standing and connections and Christian symbolism and biblical themes are common in both artists' work.\nWhite dedicated his first novel  to De Maistre and acknowledged De Maistre's influence on his writing. In 1947, De Maistre's painting  was used as the cover for the first edition of White's . White bought many of De Maistre's paintings. In 1974 White gave all his paintings by De Maistre to the .\nTowards the end of the 1930s, White spent time in the United States, including , Massachusetts, and , which were artistic hotbeds at the time, where he wrote . By the time World War II broke out, he had returned to London and joined the British . He was accepted as an intelligence officer, and was posted to the Middle East. He served in Egypt, Palestine, and Greece before the war was over. While in the Middle East, he had an affair with a Greek army officer, , who was to become his life partner.\nWhite and Lascaris lived together in Cairo for six years before moving to a small farm purchased by White at , near Sydney, in 1948. After the death of White's mother in 1963, they moved into a large house, , in , where they lived for the rest of their lives.\nAfter the war, White once again returned to Australia, buying an old house in , now a Sydney suburb but then semi-rural. He named the house \"The Dogwoods,\" after trees he planted there. In this house, he settled down with Lascaris, the Greek he had met during the war. They lived there for 18 years, selling flowers, vegetables, milk, and cream as well as pedigreed puppies. During these years he started to make a reputation for himself as a writer, publishing  and  in the United States in 1955 and shortly after in the United Kingdom.  was released to rave reviews in the United States, but in what had become a typical pattern, it was panned in Australia. White had doubts about whether to continue writing after his books were largely dismissed in Australia (three of them having been called 'un-Australian' by critics), but, in the end, he decided to persevere. His first breakthrough in Australia came when his next novel, , won the inaugural .\nIn 1961, White published . It was to become both a bestseller and a prizewinner, gaining him a second Miles Franklin Award. In 1963, White and Lascaris decided to sell the house at Castle Hill. A number of White's works from the 1960s depict the fictional town of Sarsaparilla, including his collection of short stories, , and the play, . By now, he had clearly established his reputation as one of the world's great authors, but remained an essentially private person, resisting opportunities for interviews and public appearances although his circle of friends had widened significantly.\nIn 1968, White wrote , a searing character portrait of an artist. Many people drew links to the Sydney painter  (1904\u201384) and White's friend, the painter , but White denied the connections. Patrick White was an art collector who had, as a young man, been deeply impressed by his friends  and , and later said he wished he had been an artist.  By the mid-1960s, he had also become interested in encouraging dozens of young and less established artists, such as , , and . White was later friends with , the young star of Australian painting, in the 1970s. That friendship ended when White felt that Whiteley, a heroin addict, was deceitful and pushy about selling his paintings. A portrait of White by  won the 1962 .\nWhite decided not to accept any more prizes for his work, and he declined both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by  to work on a screenplay for  but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia's decision to participate in the . His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the , but in 1971, after losing to , he wrote to a friend: .\nNevertheless, in 1973, White did accept the Nobel Prize \"for an epic and psychological narrative art, which has introduced a new continent into literature\". His cause was said to have been championed by a Scandinavian diplomat resident in Australia. White enlisted Nolan to travel to Stockholm to accept the prize on his behalf. The award had an immediate impact on his career, as his publisher doubled the print run for  and gave him a larger advance for his next novel. White used the money from the prize to establish a trust to fund the , given annually to established creative writers who have received little public recognition. He was invited by the  to be seated on the floor of the House in recognition of his achievement. White declined, explaining that his nature could not easily adapt itself to such a situation. The last time such an invitation had been extended was in 1928, to .\nWhite was made  for 1974, but in a typically rebellious fashion, his acceptance speech encouraged Australians to spend the day reflecting on the state of the country. Privately, he was less than enthusiastic about it. In a letter to Marshall Best on 27 January 1974, he wrote: \"Something terrible happened to me last week. There is an organisation which chooses an Australian of the Year, who has to appear at an official lunch in  on . This year I was picked on as they had run through all the swimmers, tennis players, yachtsmen\".\nWhite and Lascaris hosted many dinner parties at Highbury, their Centennial Park home, in a leafy part of the affluent Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. In , his biographer  portrays White as a genial host but one who easily fell out with friends.\nWhite supported the conservative, business oriented  until the election of 's  government and, following the , he became particularly , making a rare appearance on national television to broadcast his views on the matter. White also publicly expressed his admiration for the historian , satirist , and unionist .\nDuring the 1970s, White's health began to deteriorate: his teeth were crumbling, his eyesight was failing, and he had chronic lung problems - however, he also became a more openly political person, and began sometimes commenting on current issues. He was among the first group of Companions of the  in 1975 but resigned in June 1976 in protest at the dismissal of the Whitlam government in November 1975 by the Governor-General Sir . In 1979, his novel  was shortlisted for the , but White requested that it to be removed to give younger writers a chance to win. (The prize was won by , who ironically was just four years younger than White.) Soon after, White announced that he had written his last novel, and from then on, he would write only for radio or the stage.\nDirector  introduced himself to White while walking down a Sydney street, some time after White had seen a politically loaded stage revue by Sharman, , which had been panned by Sydney newspaper critics, and had written a letter to the editor of a newspaper defending the show. White felt somewhat cautious at first, not least due to the gulf in age between them, but after a while the two men became friends and Sharman and his theatrical circle, as well as his visual style as a director, would inspire White to a couple of new plays, notably  with its satirical portrayal of a posh and vulgar upper-class Sydney society. A few years later, Sharman asked White if he could make a film of . White agreed and wrote the screenplay for the film.\nIn 1981, White published his autobiography, , which explored issues about which he had publicly said little such as his homosexuality, his dislike of the \"subservient\" attitude of Australian society towards Britain and the Royal family, and also the distance he had felt towards his mother. On , 1982, White addressed a crowd of 30,000 people, calling for a ban on  and for the destruction of .\nIn 1986 White released one last novel, , but it was published under the pen name \"Alex Xenophon Demirjian Gray\" with White named as editor. In the same year,  was turned into , with music by  and the libretto adapted by . White refused to see it when it was first performed at the , because  had been invited, and chose instead to see it later in Sydney. In 1987, White wrote , with his musings on ageing and society's efforts to achieve aesthetic perfection. When David Marr finished his biography of White in July 1990, his subject spent nine days going over the details with him.\nWhite died in Sydney on 30 September 1990.\nIn 2009, The Sydney Theatre Company staged White's play . In 2010 White received posthumous recognition for his novel , which was shortlisted for the  for 1970.\nIn 2011 Fred Schepisi's  of  was released with screenplay adaptation by ,  playing the son Basil,  as the daughter Dorothy, and  as the dying matriarch Elizabeth Hunter. This is the first screen realisation of a White novel, fittingly the one that played a key role in the Swedish panel's choice of White as Nobel prize winner.\nIn 1970, White was offered a knighthood but declined it.\nBoth White and  were members of the first group of six people appointed  (AC) in the civil division, (now called the general division). The awards were announced in the 1975 Queen's Birthday Honours List.

The first 30 out of 100 samples showed no support for their hypothesis. However, it was discovered that the lab technicians had been throwing out the cultures after 2 days. This was standard practice for throat swabs where other organisms in the mouth rendered cultures as not useful after 2 days. Due to other hospital work, the lab technicians did not have time to immediately throw out the 31st test on the second day, and so it stayed from Thursday through to the Monday.

Her family moved to the city of  when she was four, where she attended the Broadland House Church of England Girls' Grammar School (later amalgamated with ) until the age of sixteen. Upon her family's relocation to , she attended , and ultimately gained very high marks in the end-of-year final statewide matriculation exams. She went on to earn a  in 1970 and  in 1972, both from the  in the field of biochemistry. Blackburn then went to receive her  in 1975 from the , where she worked with Frederick Sanger developing methods to sequence DNA using RNA, as well as studying the bacteriophage . It was also here, the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge University, where Blackburn met her husband John Sedat. Blackburn's soon to be husband had taken a position at Yale, where she then decided to finish her postdoctoral. \u201cThus it was that love brought me to a most fortunate and influential choice: Joe Gall\u2019s lab at Yale.\u201d\nDuring her postdoctoral work at Yale, Blackburn was doing research on the protozoan  and noticed a repeating  at the end of the linear rDNA which varied in size Blackburn then noticed that this hexanucleotide at the end of the chromosome contained a TTAGGG sequence that was , and the terminal end of the chromosomes were palindromic. These characteristics allowed Blackburn and colleagues to conduct further research on the protozoan. Using the telomeric repeated end of , Blackburn and colleague Jack Szostak showed the unstable replicating plasmids of yeast were protected from degradation, proving that these sequences contained characteristics of telomeres. This research also proved the telomeric repeats of  were conserved evolutionarily between the species. Through this research, Blackburn and collaborators noticed the replication system for chromosomes was not likely to add to the lengthening of the telomere, and that the addition of these hexanucleotides to the chromosomes was likely due to the activity of an enzyme that is able to transfer specific functional groups. The proposition of a possible transferase-like enzyme led Blackburn and PhD student Carol W. Greider to the discovery of an enzyme with reverse transcriptase activity that was able to fill in the terminal ends of telomeres without leaving the chromosome incomplete and unable to divide without loss of the end of the chromosome. This 1985 discovery led to the purification of this enzyme in lab, showing the transferase-like enzyme contained both RNA and protein components. The RNA portion of the enzyme served as a template for adding the telomeric repeats to the incomplete telomere, and the protein added enzymatic function for the addition of these repeats.Through this breakthrough, the term \u201ctelomerase\u201d was given to the enzyme, solving the end-replication process that had troubled scientists at the time.\n works by adding base pairs to the overhang of DNA on the 3\u2019 end, extending the strand until DNA polymerase and an RNA primer can complete the complementary strand and successfully synthesize the double stranded DNA. Since DNA polymerase only synthesizes DNA in the leading strand direction, the shortening of the telomere results. Through their research, Blackburn and collaborators were able to show that the telomere is effectively replenished by the enzyme telomerase, which conserves cellular division by preventing the rapid loss of genetic information internal to the telomere, leading to cellular aging.\n\n\nOn January 1, 2016, Blackburn was interviewed about her studies, discovering telomerase, and her current research. When she was asked to recall the moment of telomerase discovery she stated:In 1978, Blackburn joined the faculty of the , in the Department of Molecular Biology. In 1990, she moved across the San Francisco Bay to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the  (UCSF), where she served as the Department Chair from 1993 to 1999 and was the Morris Herzstein Professor of Biology and Physiology at UCSF. Blackburn became a Professor Emeritus at UCSF at the end of 2015.\nBlackburn, co-founded the company Telomere Health which offers telomere length testing to the public, but later severed ties with the company.\nIn 2015, Elizabeth Blackburn was announced as the new President of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. \u201cFew scientists garner the kind of admiration and respect that Dr. Blackburn receives from her peers for her scientific accomplishments and her leadership, service and integrity,\u201d says Irwin M. Jacobs, chairman of Salk's Board of Trustees, on Blackburn's appointment as President of the Institute. \u201cHer deep insight as a scientist, her vision as a leader, and her warm personality will prove invaluable as she guides the Salk Institute on its continuing journey of discovery.\u201d \u00a0In 2017, she announced her plans to retire from the Salk Institute the following year.\nFor their research and contributions to the understanding of telomeres and the enzyme telomerase, Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider, and Jack Szostaks were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The substantial research on the effects of chromosomal protection from telomerase, and the impact this has on cellular division has been a revolutionary catalyst in the field of molecular biology. For example, the addition of telomerase to cells that do not possess this enzyme has shown to bypass the limit of cellular aging in those cells, thereby linking this enzyme to reduced cellular aging. The addition of telomerase, and the presence of the enzyme in cancer cells has been shown to provide an immunity mechanism for the cell in proliferating, linking the transferase activity to increased cellular growth and reduced sensitivity for cellular signalling. The importance of discovering this enzyme has since sent led her continued research at the University of California San Francisco, where she studies the effect of telomeres and telomerase activity on cellular aging.\nBlackburn was appointed a member of the  in 2002. She supported human embryonic cell research, in opposition to the Bush Administration. Her Council terms were terminated by  directive on 27 February 2004. Dr. Blackburn believes that she was dismissed from the Council due to her disapproval of the Bush administration's position against stem cell research. This was followed by expressions of outrage over her removal by many scientists, 170 of whom signed an open letter to the president maintaining that she was fired because of political opposition to her advice.\nScientists and ethicists at the time even went as far to say that Blackburn's removal was in violation of Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which \u201crequires balance on such advisory bodies\u201d\n\"There is a growing sense that scientific research\u2014which, after all, is defined by the quest for truth\u2014is being manipulated for political ends,\" wrote Blackburn. \"There is evidence that such manipulation is being achieved through the stacking of the membership of advisory bodies and through the delay and misrepresentation of their reports.\"\nBlackburn serves on the Science Advisory Board of the Regenerative Medicine Foundation formerly known as the Genetics Policy Institute.\nBlackburn's first book  (2017) was co-authored with  Dr. Elissa Epel of Aging, Metabolism, and Emotions (AME) Center at the UCSF Center for Health and Community. Blackburn comments on aging reversal and care for one's telomeres through lifestyle: managing chronic stress, exercising, eating better and getting enough sleep; telomere testing, plus cautions and advice. While studying telomeres and the replenishing enzyme, telomerase, Blackburn discovered a vital role played by these protective caps that revolved around one central idea: aging of cells. The book hones in on many of the effects that poor health can have on telomeres and telomerase activity. Since telomeres shorten with every division of a cell, replenishing these caps is essential to long term cell growth. Through research and data, Blackburn explained that people that lead stressful lives exhibit less telomerase functioning in the body, which leads to a decrease in the dividing capabilities of the cell. Once telomeres shorten drastically, the cells can no longer divide, meaning the tissues they replenish with every division would therefore die out, highlighting the aging mechanism in humans. To increase telomerase activity in people with stress-filled lives, Blackburn suggests moderate exercise, even 15 minutes a day, which has been proven to stimulate telomerase activity and replenish the telomere.\nBlackburn also states that unhappiness in lives also has an effect on the shortening of telomeres. In a study done on divorced couples, their telomere length was \"significantly shorter\" compared to couples in healthy relationships, and Blackburn states, \"There's an obvious stressor... we are intensely social beings.\" She suggests to include positivity into our daily lives to increase health as well. While increasing the amount of exercise, decreasing stress, tobacco use, and maintaining a balanced sleep schedule, Blackburn explains that our telomeres can be drastically maintained and prevented from rapid shortening, leading to a decrease in the aging process of our cells. Blackburn also tells the readers to be wary of clinical pills who proclaim to lengthen or telomeres and protect the body from aging. She says that these pills and creams have no scientific proof of being anti-aging supplements, and that the key to preserving our telomeres and stimulating telomerase activity comes from leading a healthy life.\nIn recent years Blackburn and her colleagues have been investigating the effect of stress on telomerase and telomeres with particular emphasis on  meditation. She is also one of several biologists (and one of two Nobel Prize laureates) in the 1995 science documentary . Studies suggest that chronic psychological stress may accelerate ageing at the cellular level. Intimate partner violence was found to shorten telomere length in formerly abused women versus never abused women, possibly causing poorer overall health and greater morbidity in abused women.\nAt the University of California San Francisco, Blackburn currently researches telomeres and telomerase in many organisms, from yeast to human cells. The lab is focused on telomere maintenance, and how this has an impact on cellular aging. Many chronic diseases have been associated with the improper maintenance of these telomeres, thereby effecting cellular division, cycling, and impaired growth. At the cutting edge of telomere research, the Blackburn lab currently investigates the impact of limited maintenance of telomeres in cells through altering the enzyme telomerase.\nBlackburns awards and honors include:\nBlackburn was elected:\nIn 2007, Blackburn was listed among 's \nBlackburn splits her time living between La Jolla and  with her husband, scientist John W. Sedat, whom she met while at Cambridge, and has a son, Benjamin. In her personal life, Blackburn serves as a mentor and advocate for scientific research and policy, influencing generations to come to continue the research and work that she has initiated.\n"},

He married the daughter of president . Saavedra Lamas achieved renown not only as foreign minister of Argentina for his practical work in drafting international agreements and in conducting international mediation, but also as a professor for his scholarship in the fields of labor legislation and international law.\nSaavedra Lamas was a distinguished student at Lacordaire College and at the  where he received the Doctor of Laws degree in 1903, . After study in Paris and travel abroad, he accepted a professorship in law and constitutional history at the , where he began the teaching career that was to span more than forty years. Later, he inaugurated a course in sociology at the University of Buenos Aires, taught political economy and constitutional law in the Law School of the university, and eventually served as the president of the university.\nSaavedra Lamas was a leading Argentine academician in two areas. A pioneer in the field of labor legislation, he edited several treatises on labor legislation in Argentina and on the need for a universally recognized doctrine on the treatment of labor - among them, Centro de legislac\u00edon social y del trabajo (1927) [Center of Social and Labor Legislation], Trait\u00e9s internationaux de type social (1924), C\u00f3digo nacional del trabajo (three volumes, 1933) [National Code of Labor Law]. In the arena of practical affairs, Saavedra Lamas drafted legislation affecting labor in Argentina, supported the founding of the International Labor Organization in 1919, and presided over the ILO Conference of 1928 in Geneva while serving simultaneously as leader of the Argentine delegation.\nIn international law, his other field of major scholarly interest, he published \"La Crise de la codification et de la doctrine Argentine de droit international\" (1931); and he spoke, wrote, or drafted legislation on many subjects with international ramifications - among them, asylum, colonization, immigration, arbitration, and international peace. His brief Vida internacional, which he wrote at the age of seventy, is an urbane by-product of all this study and experience.\nSaavedra Lamas began his political career in 1906 as director of Public Credit and then became the secretary-general for the municipality of Buenos Aires in 1907. In 1908 he was elected to the first of two successive terms in Parliament. There he initiated legislation regarding coastal water rights, irrigation, sugar production, government finances, colonization, and immigration. His main interest, however, lay in foreign affairs. He provided leadership in saving Argentina's arbitration treaty with Italy, which almost foundered in 1907-1908, and eventually became the unofficial adviser to both the legislature and the foreign office on the analysis and implications of proposed foreign treaties. Saavedra Lamas though was also a controversial public figure as he was seen by the masses as an elitist patrician who was too conservative and favored British intervention, especially in railroad construction.\nAppointed minister of Justice and Education in 1915, he instituted educational reforms by integrating the different divisions of public education and by developing a curriculum at the intermediate level for the vocational and technical training of manpower needed in a developing industrial country.\nWhen General  became president of Argentina in 1932, he appointed Saavedra Lamas as foreign minister. In this post for six years, Saavedra Lamas brought international prestige to Argentina. He played an important role in every South American diplomatic issue of the middle thirties, induced Argentina to rejoin the League of Nations after an absence of thirteen years, and represented Argentina at virtually every international meeting of consequence during this period.\nHis work in ending the  between Paraguay and Bolivia (1932\u20131935) had not only local significance but generalized international importance as well. When he took over the foreign office, he immediately engaged in a series of moves to lay the diplomatic groundwork for a negotiated settlement of this dispute. In 1932 he initiated at Washington the Declaration of August 3 which put the American states on record as refusing to recognize any territorial change in the hemisphere brought about by force. Next, he drew up a Treaty of Nonaggression and Conciliation which was signed by six South American countries in October, 1933, and by all of the American countries at the Seventh Pan-American Conference at Montevideo two months later. In 1935 he organized mediation by six neutral American nations which resulted in the cessation of hostilities between Paraguay and Bolivia. Meanwhile, in 1934, Saavedra Lamas presented the South American Antiwar Pact to the League of Nations where it was well received and signed by eleven countries. Acclaimed for all of these efforts, he was elected president of the Assembly of the League of Nations in 1936.\nAfter his retirement from the foreign ministry in 1938, Saavedra Lamas returned to academic life, became president of the University of Buenos Aires for two years (1941\u20131943), and rounded out his career as a professor for an additional three years (1943\u20131946).\nSaavedra Lamas was known as a strict disciplinarian in his office, a logician at the conference table, a charming host in his home or his art gallery, and a man of sartorial elegance who wore, it is said, the highest collars in Buenos Aires. In addition to the , he was awarded the  and analogous honors from ten other countries.\nHe died in 1959 at the age of eighty from the effects of a brain hemorrhage.\nIn March 2014 his solid gold Nobel medal was put up for auction after being found in a South American pawn shop.\nIn August 2014 a project for rebuying his Nobel medal by the Argentine Nation was presented at the Argentine congress. His auctioned medal was later won and is now owned by a private Asian collector.\n\n"},

His education was divided between Escuela General San Mart\u00edn (primary school),  (secondary school), and for a few months at  in . His grades were unspectacular, and his first stint in college ended quickly when he abandoned his architectural studies that he had begun in Paris' .\nIt was during the 1920s that Leloir invented  (golf sauce). After being served prawns with the usual sauce during lunch with a group of friends at the Ocean Club in Mar del Plata, Leloir came up with a peculiar combination of ketchup and mayonnaise to spice up his meal. With the financial difficulties that later plagued Leloir's laboratories and research, he would joke, \"If I had patented that sauce, we'd have a lot more money for research right now.\"\nAfter returning again to , Leloir obtained his Argentine citizenship and joined the Department of Medicine at the  in hopes of receiving his doctorate. However, he got off to a rocky start, requiring four attempts to pass his anatomy exam. He finally received his diploma in 1932 and began his residency in the  and his medical internship in Ramos Mej\u00eda hospital. After some initial conflicts with colleagues and complications in his method of treating patients, Leloir decided to dedicate himself to research in the laboratory, claiming that \"we could do little for our patients... antibiotics, psychoactive d, and all the new therapeutic agents were unknown [at the time].\"\nIn 1933, he met , who pointed Leloir towards investigating in his doctoral thesis the  and carbohydrate metabolism. Houssay happened to be friends with , the brother-in-law of , one of Leloir's cousins. Following the recommendation of Udaondo, Leloir began working with Houssay, who in 1947 would later win the . The two would develop a close relationship, collaborating on various projects until Houssay's death in 1971; in his lecture after winning the Nobel Prize, Leloir claimed that his \"whole research career has been influenced by one person, Prof. Bernardo A. Houssay\".\nAfter only two years, Leloir received recognition from the medical department at UBA for having produced the best doctoral thesis. Feeling that his knowledge in fields such as , , , and  was lacking, he continued attending classes at the University as a part-time student. In 1936 he traveled to England to begin advanced studies at the , under the supervision of another Nobel Prize winner, Sir , who had obtained that distinction in 1929 for his work in  and in revealing the critical role of  in maintaining good health. Leloir's research in the Biochemical Laboratory of Cambridge centered around , more specifically the effects of  and  on succinic dehydrogenase; from this moment Leloir began to specialize in researching carbohydrate metabolism.\nLeloir returned to Buenos Aires in 1937 after his brief stay at Cambridge. 1943 saw Leloir marry; Luis Leloir and Amelia Zuberbuhler (1920-2013) would later have a daughter also named Amelia. However, his return to Argentina was amidst conflict and strife;  Houssay had been expelled from the University of Buenos Aires for signing a public petition opposing the  regime in  and the military government led  by . Leloir fled to the , where he assumed the position of associate professor in the Department of  at , collaborating with  and  and thereafter worked with  at the College of Physicians and Surgeons,  as a research assistant. Leloir would later credit Green with instilling within him the initiative to establish his own research in Argentina.\nIn 1945, Leloir ended his exile and returned to Argentina to work under Houssay at the , which Leloir would direct from its creation in 1947 by businessman and patron . Initially, the institute was composed of five rooms, a bathroom, central hall, patio, kitchen, and changing room. During the final years of the 1940s, although lacking financial resources and operating with very low-cost teams, Leloir's successful experiments would reveal the chemical origins of sugar synthesis in  as well as the  of  in the liver; together with J. M. Mu\u00f1oz, he produced an active cell-free system, a first in scientific research. It had initially been assumed that in order to study a cell, scientists could not separate it from its host organism, as oxidation could only occur in intact cells. Along the way, Mu\u00f1oz and Leloir, unable to procure the costly centrifuge needed to separate cell contents, improvised by spinning a tire stuffed with salt and ice.\nBy 1947 he had formed a team that included \nCaputto, Enrico Cabib, Ra\u00fal Trucco, Alejandro Paladini, Carlos Cardini and Jos\u00e9 Luis Reissig, with whom he investigated and discovered why a malfunctioning kidney and  helped cause . That same year,  his colleague , in his investigations of the , made discoveries regarding carbohydrate storage and its subsequent transformation into a reserve energy form in organisms.\nAt the beginning of 1948, Leloir and his team identified the sugar nucleotides that were fundamental to the metabolism of carbohydrates, turning the Instituto Campomar into a biochemistry institution well known throughout the world. Immediately thereafter, Leloir received the Argentine Scientific Society Prize,  one of the many awards he would receive both in Argentina and internationally. During this time, his team dedicated itself to the study of ; Leloir and his colleagues elucidated the primary mechanisms of galactose metabolism (now coined the ) and determined the cause of galactosemia, a serious  that resulted in .\nThe following year, he reached an agreement with Rolando Garc\u00eda, dean of the  at UBA, which named Leloir, Carlos Eugenio Cardini and Enrico Cabib as titular professors in the University's newly founded Biochemical Institute. The Institute would help develop scientific programs in budding Argentine universities as well as attract researchers and scholars from the United States, , England, France, Spain, and other Latin American countries.\nFollowing Campomar's death in 1957, Leloir and his team applied to the  in the United States desperate for funding, and surprisingly was accepted. In 1958, the Institute found a new home in a former all-girls school, a donation from the Argentine government. As Leloir and his research gained greater prominence, further research came from the Argentine Research Council, and the Institute would later become associated with the University of Buenos Aires.\nAs his work in the laboratory was coming to an end, Leloir continued his teaching position in the Department of Natural Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires, taking a hiatus only to complete his studies at Cambridge and at the Enzyme Research Laboratory in the United States.\nIn 1983, Leloir became one of the founding members of the Third World Academy of Sciences, later renamed the .\nOn December 2, 1970, Leloir received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry from the King of  for his discovery of the  in , becoming only the third Argentine to receive the prestigious honor in any field. In his acceptance speech at , he borrowed from 's famous 1940 speech to the  and remarked, \"never have I received so much for so little\".

The $80,000 prize money was spent directly on research, and when asked about the significance of his achievement, Leloir responded:\nLeloir published a short autobiography, entitled \"Long Ago and Far Away\" in the 1983 . The title, Leloir claims, is derived from one of 's novels that depicted the country wildlife and scenery of Leloir's childhood.\nHe died in Buenos Aires December 2, 1987, of a heart attack soon after returning to his home from the laboratory, and is buried in . , a friend and colleague of Leloir, claims that his lasting legacy was proving that \"scientific research on an international level, although precarious, was possible in an underdeveloped country in the middle of political strife\" and credits Leloir's vigilance and will for his ultimate success. With his research in dire financial straits, Leloir often resorted to homemade gadgets and contraptions to continue his work in the laboratory. In one instance, Leloir reportedly used waterproof cardboard to create makeshift gutters in order to protect his laboratory's library from the rain.\nLeloir was known for his humility, focus and consistency, described by many as a \"true monk in science\".

His parents were M\u00e1xima (Vapniarsky) and L\u00e1zaro Milstein, a  immigrant. He graduated from the  and obtained a PhD under Professor Stoppani (Professor of ). Thereafter, he was a member of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, England, and held dual Argentine and British citizenship. In 1956, he received an award from the Sociedad Bioqu\u00edmica Argentina for his work on  with the  aldehyde dehydrogenase. In 1958, funded by the , he joined the  Department at the  at  to work for a PhD under  on the mechanism of metal activation of the enzyme . During this work, he collaborated with  whose group he joined with a short-term  appointment.\nThe major part of Milstein's research career was devoted to studying the structure of antibodies and the mechanism by which antibody diversity is generated. It was as part of this quest that, in 1975, he worked with  (a postdoctoral fellow in his laboratory) to develop the  technique for the production of \u2014a discovery recognized by the award of the 1984 . This discovery led to an enormous expansion in the exploitation of antibodies in science and medicine.\nMilstein himself made many major contributions to improvements and developments in monoclonal antibody technology\u2014especially in the use of  to provide markers that allow distinction between different cell types. In collaboration with Claudio Cuello, Milstein helped lay the foundation for the use of monoclonal antibodies as probes for the investigation of the pathological pathways in neurological disorders as well as many other diseases. Milstein and Cuello's work also enabled the use of monoclonal antibodies to enhance the power of immuno-based diagnostic tests. In addition, Milstein foresaw the potential wealth of ligand-binding reagents that could result from applying recombinant  technology to monoclonal antibodies and inspired the development of the field of antibody engineering which was to lead to safer and more powerful monoclonal antibodies for use as therapeutics.\nMilstein's early work on antibodies focused on their diversity at the amino acid level, as well as on the disulfide bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies, where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted  that contained a signal sequence. The development of the  technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of  of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody . In this process, localized mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved , which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in recent years was devoted to characterizing this mutational process, with a view to understanding its mechanism. He contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.\nQuite apart from his own achievements, Milstein acted as a guide and inspiration to many in the antibody field, as well as devoting himself to assisting science and scientists in less developed countries. It is also worth mentioning, that even though the Nobel Prize would have made him a wealthy man, Milstein did not patent his enormous discovery since he believed that it was mankind's intellectual property. According to his beliefs, his work did not have any economic interest, only scientific.\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize 1984, Milstein was elected a , was a fellow of  from 1980 to 2002, awarded the  from  in 1980, won the  in 1989, and became a  in 1995.

He was joint recipient (with his father, ) of the  in 1915, \"For their services in the analysis of  by means of \"; an important step in the development of X-ray crystallography.\nBragg was  in 1941. As of 2020, he is the youngest ever  in physics, having received the award at the age of 25 years (youngest ever Nobel winner in any field is , who received Nobel Peace prize in 2014 at the age of 17). Bragg was the director of the , Cambridge, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was reported by  and  in February 1953.\nBragg was born in , South Australia to  (1862\u20131942),  Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the , and Gwendoline (1869\u20131929), daughter of , government astronomer of South Australia.\nHe showed an early interest in science and mathematics. Shortly after starting school he fell from his tricycle and broke his arm. His father, who had read about 's experiments in Europe and was performing his own experiments, used the newly discovered X-rays and his experimental equipment to examine the broken arm. This is the first recorded surgical use of X-rays in Australia.\nIn 1900, Bragg was a student at , followed by five years at . He went to the University of Adelaide at the age of 16 to study mathematics, chemistry and physics, graduating in 1908. In the same year his father accepted the Cavendish chair of physics at the , and brought the family to England. Bragg entered  in the autumn of 1909 and received a major scholarship in mathematics, despite taking the exam while in bed with . After initially excelling in mathematics, he transferred to the physics course in the later years of his studies, and graduated with first class honours in 1911. In 1914 Bragg was elected to a Fellowship at Trinity College \u2013 a Fellowship at a Cambridge college involves the submission and defence of a thesis.\nAmong Bragg's other interests was ; his personal collection amounted to specimens from some 500 species; all personally collected from South Australia. He discovered a new species of  \u2013 , named for him by .\nThe composition of X-rays was unknown, his father argued that X-rays are streams of particles, others argued that they are waves.  directed an X-ray beam at a crystal in front of a photographic plate; alongside of the spot where the beam struck there were additional spots from deflected rays \u2013 hence X-rays are waves. In 1912, as a first-year research student at Cambridge, W. L. Bragg, while strolling by the river, had the insight that crystals made from parallel sheets of atoms would not diffract X-ray beams that struck their surface at most angles because X-rays deflected by collisions with atoms would be out of phase, cancelling one another out. However, when the X-ray beam stuck at an angle at which the distances it passed between atomic sheets in the crystal equalled the X-ray's wavelength then those deflected would be in phase and produce a spot on a nearby film. From this insight he wrote the simple  that relates the wavelength of the X-ray and the distance between atomic sheets in a simple crystal to the angles at which an impinging X-ray beam would be reflected.\nHis father built an  in which a crystal could be rotated to precise angles while measuring the energy of reflections. This enabled father and son to measure the distances between the atomic sheets in a number of simple crystals. They calculated the spacing of the atoms from the weight of the crystal and the , which enabled them to measure the wavelengths of the X-rays produced by different metallic targets in the X-ray tubes. W. H. Bragg reported their results at meetings and in a paper, giving credit to \"his son\" (unnamed) for the equation, but not as a co-author, which gave his son \"some heartaches\", .\nBragg was commissioned early in  in the  as a  of the . In 1915 he was seconded to the  to develop a method to localise enemy artillery from the boom of their firing. On 2 September 1915 his brother was killed during the . Shortly afterwards, he and his father were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. He was 25 years old and remains the youngest science laureate. The problem with  was that the heavy guns boomed at too low a frequency to be detected by a microphone. After months of frustrating failure he and his group devised a hot wire air wave detector that solved the problem. In this work he was aided by , ,  and Henry Harold Hemming. British sound ranging was very effective; there was a unit in every British Army and their system was adopted by the Americans when they entered the war. For his work during the war he was awarded the  and appointed . He was also  on 16 June 1916, 4 January 1917 and 7 July 1919.\nHot wire sound ranging was used in  during which he served as a civilian adviser.\nBetween the wars, from 1919 to 1937, he worked at the  as  of Physics. He became the director of the  in Teddington in 1937.\nAfter World War II, Bragg returned to Cambridge, splitting the  into research groups. He believed that \"the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants\".\nWhen demobilised he returned to crystallography at Cambridge. They had agreed that father would study organic crystals, son would investigate inorganic compounds. In 1919 when , a long-time family friend, moved to Cambridge, Lawrence Bragg replaced him as Langworthy Professor of Physics at the . He recruited an excellent faculty, including former sound rangers, but he believed that his knowledge of physics was weak and he had no classroom experience. The students, many veterans, were critical and rowdy. He was deeply shaken but with family support he pulled himself together and prevailed. He and R. W. James measured the absolute energy of reflected X-rays, which validated a formula derived by C. G. Darwin before the war. Now they could determine the number of electrons in the reflecting targets, and they were able to decipher the structures of more complicated crystals like silicates. It was still difficult: requiring repeated guessing and retrying. In the late 1920s they eased the analysis by using  on the data.\nIn 1930 he became deeply disturbed while weighing a job offer from Imperial College, London. His family rallied around and he recovered his balance while they spent 1931 in Munich, where he did research.\nHe became director of the  in Teddington in 1937, bringing some co-workers along. However, administration and committees took much of his time away from the workbench.\nRutherford died and the search committee named Lawrence Bragg as next in the line of the  who direct the . The Laboratory had an eminent history in atomic physics and some members were wary of a crystallographer, which Bragg surmounted by even-handed administration. He worked on improving the interpretation of diffraction patterns. In the small crystallography group was a refugee research student without a mentor: . He showed Bragg X-ray diffraction data from , which suggested that the structure of giant biological molecules might be deciphered. Bragg appointed Perutz as his research assistant and within a few months obtained additional support with a grant from the . The work was suspended during the Second World War when Perutz was interned as an enemy alien and then worked in military research.\nDuring the war the Cavendish offered a shortened graduate course which emphasised the electronics needed for . Bragg worked on the structure of metals and consulted on sonar and sound ranging, they still used the Tucker microphone. He became Sir Lawrence in 1941. His father died in 1942, during which Bragg served for six months as Scientific Liaison Officer to Canada. He organised periodic conferences on X-ray analysis, which was widely used in military research.\nAfter the war he led in the formation of the  and was elected its first president. He reorganised the Cavendish into units to reflect his conviction that \"the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants, helped by one or more first-class instrument mechanics and a workshop in which the general run of apparatus can be constructed.\" Senior members of staff now had offices, telephones and secretarial support. The scope of the department was enlarged with a new unit on radio astronomy. His own work focused on the structure of metals, using both X-rays and the . In 1947 he persuaded the  (MRC) to support what he described as the \"gallant attempt\" to determine protein structure as the , initially consisting of Perutz,  and two assistants. Bragg worked with them, by 1960 they had resolved the structure of  to the atomic level. After this he was less involved; their analysis of  was easier after they incorporated two mercury atoms as markers in each molecule. The first monumental triumph of the MRC was decoding the structure of DNA by  and . Bragg announced the discovery at a  on proteins in Belgium on 8 April 1953, it went unreported by the press. He then gave a talk at  in London on Thursday 14 May 1953, which resulted in an article by  in the  of London on Friday 15 May 1953, entitled \"Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life\". Bragg nominated Crick, Watson and  for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; Wilkins' share recognised the contribution of X-ray crystallographers at . Among them was , whose \"\" showed that DNA was a double , not the triple helix that  had proposed. Franklin died before the prize (which only goes to living people) was awarded.\nIn 1953 the Braggs moved into the elegant flat for the Resident Professor in the  in London, the position his father had occupied when he died. In 1934 and 1961 Lawrence had delivered the  and since 1938 he had been Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Institution, delivering an annual lecture. His father's successors had weakened the Institution, so Bragg had to rebuild it. He bolstered finances by enlisting corporate sponsors, the traditional Friday Evening Discourses were followed by a dinner party for the speaker and carefully selected possible patrons, more than 120 of them each year. \"Two of these Discourses in 1965 gave him particular pleasure. On 7 May, Lady Bragg, who had been a member of the Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce (1951\u201355) and was Chairman of the , lectured on 'Changing patterns in marriage and divorce'; and on 15 November, Bragg listened with evident pride to the Discourse on 'Oscillations and noise in jet engines' given by his engineer-son , who was then Chief Scientist at Rolls Royce Ltd and later became Vice-Chancellor of .\" He also introduced a programme of highly regarded Schools' Lectures, enlivened by the elaborate demonstrations that were a hallmark of the Institution. He gave three of these lectures on \"electricity\".\nHe continued research in the Institution by recruiting a small group to work the Davy-Faraday Laboratory in the basement and in the adjoining house, supported by grants he obtained. A visitor to the laboratory succeeded in inserting heavy metals into the enzyme ; the structure of its crystal was solved in 1965 at the Royal Institution by  and his coworkers, with the computations on the 9,040 reflections performed on the digital computer at the University of London, which greatly facilitated the work. Two of the illustrations of the positioning of amino acids in the chain were drawn by Bragg. Unlike myoglobin, in which nearly 80 per cent of the amino-acid residues are in the  conformation, in lysozyme the alpha-helix content is only about 40 per cent of the amino-acid residues found in four main stretches. Other stretches are of the , a conformation that they had proposed earlier. In this conformation, every third peptide is hydrogen-bonded back to the first peptide, thus forming a ring containing ten atoms. They had the complete structure of an enzyme in time for Bragg's 75th birthday. He became Professor Emeritus in 1966.\nX-ray analysis of protein structure flourished in subsequent years, determining the structures of scores of proteins in laboratories around the world. Twenty eight Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work using X-ray analysis. The disadvantage of the method is that it must be done on crystals, which precludes seeing changes in shape when enzymes bind substrates and the like. This problem was solved by the development of another line Bragg had initiated, using modified electron microscopes to image single frozen molecules: .\nIn his long association with the  he was:\nIn 1921 he married Alice Hopkinson (1899\u20131989), a cousin of a friend who had been killed in the war. They had four children, the engineer  (1923\u20132014), David William (1926\u20132005), Margaret Alice, born 1931, (who married the diplomat ) and Patience Mary, born 1935. Alice was on the staff at  until Bragg was appointed director of the National Physical Laboratory in 1937. She was active in a number of public bodies and served as  from 1945-46.\nBragg's hobbies included drawing \u2013 family letters were illustrated with lively sketches \u2013 painting, literature and a lifelong interest in gardening. When he moved to London, he missed having a garden and so worked as a part-time gardener, unrecognised by his employer, until a guest at the house expressed surprise at seeing him there. He died at a hospital near his home at , , Suffolk. He was buried in ; his son David is buried in the  in Cambridge, where Bragg's friend, who had he survived would have been his brother-in-law, Rudolph Cecil Hopkinson is also buried.\nIn August 2013, Bragg's relative, the broadcaster , presented a BBC Radio 4 programme (\"Bragg on the Braggs\") on the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics winners.\nBragg was elected a  \u2013 \"a qualification that makes other ones irrelevant\".

However, the researchers did not have enough penicillin to help him to a full recovery, and he relapsed and died. Because of this experience and the difficulty in producing penicillin, the researchers changed their focus to children, who could be treated with smaller quantities of penicillin.\nFlorey's research team investigated the large-scale production of the mould and efficient extraction of the active ingredient, succeeding to the point where, by 1945, penicillin production was an industrial process for the Allies in World War II.

He went on to conduct pioneering research in  and  at the , Melbourne, and served as director of the Institute from 1944 to 1965. From 1965 until his retirement in 1978, Burnet worked at the . Throughout his career he played an active role in the development of public policy for the medical sciences in Australia and was a founding member of the  (AAS), and served as its president from 1965 to 1969.\nBurnet's major achievements in microbiology included discovering the causative agents of  and ; developing  for the isolation, culture and detection of ; describing the recombination of influenza ; demonstrating that the  virus does not cause disease in humans. Modern methods for producing  are still based on Burnet's work improving virus growing processes in .\nBurnet was the most highly decorated and honoured scientist to have worked in Australia. For his contributions to Australian science, he was made the first  in 1960, and in 1978 a Knight of the . He was recognised internationally for his achievements: in addition to the Nobel, he received the  and the  and  from the , honorary doctorates, and distinguished service honours from the  and Japan.\nBurnet was born in , ; his father, Frank Burnet, a Scottish emigrant to Australia, was the manager of the Traralgon branch of the Colonial Bank. His mother Hadassah Burnet (n\u00e9e Mackay) was the daughter of a middle-class Scottish immigrant, and met his father when Frank was working in the town of . Frank was 36, and 14 years older than Hadassah. The family was socially conservative Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Frank Macfarlane Burnet was the second of seven children and from childhood was known as \"Mac\". He had an older sister, two younger sisters and three younger brothers. The eldest daughter Doris had a mental disability that consumed most of Hadassah's time and the family saw Doris's condition as an unspoken stigma, discouraging the other children from inviting friends home, lest they come across the eldest daughter. From his early years in Traralgon, Mac enjoyed exploring the environment around him, particularly Traralgon Creek. He first attended a private school run by a single teacher before starting at the government primary school at the age of 7. Mac was distant from his father\u2014who liked to spend his free time fishing and playing golf\u2014from a young age. He preferred bookish pursuits from a young age and was not enamoured of sport, and by the age of eight was old enough to analyse his father's character; Mac disapproved of Frank and saw him as a hypocrite who espoused moral principles and put on a facade of uprightedness, while associating with businessmen of dubious ethics. Hadassah was preoccupied with Doris, so Mac developed a rather solitary personality.\nThe Burnets moved to  in 1909, when Frank was posted to be the bank manager there, having declined a post in London. Burnet was interested in the wildlife around the nearby ; he joined the  in 1910 and enjoyed all outdoor activities. While living in Terang, he began to collect  and study biology. He read biology articles in the , which introduced him to the work of . During his early teens, the family took annual holidays to , where Burnet spent his time observing and recording the behaviour of the wildlife. He was educated at Terang State School and attended Sunday school at the local church, where the priest encouraged him to pursue scholastic studies and awarded him a book on ants as a reward for his academic performance. He advised Frank to invest in Mac's education and he won a full scholarship to board and study at , one of Victoria's most exclusive private schools. Starting there in 1913, Burnet was the only boarder with a full scholarship. He did not enjoy his time there among the scions of the ruling upper class; while most of his peers were brash and sports-oriented, Burnet was bookish and not athletically inclined, and found his fellow students to be arrogant and boorish. During this period he kept his beetle-collecting and disapproval of his peers a secret and mixed with his schoolmates out of necessity. Nevertheless, his academic prowess gained him privileges, and he graduated in 1916, placing first in his school overall, and in history, English, chemistry and physics. The typical university path for a person of his social background was to pursue studies in theology, law or medicine. By this time, he was becoming disillusioned with religion and chose medicine. Due to World War I, military service was a possibility and he felt that a medical background would increase his chances of being given a non-combat post.\nFrom 1918, Burnet attended the , where he lived in  on a residential scholarship. There, he read more of Darwin's work and was influenced by the ideas of science and society in the writings of . He enjoyed his time at university and spent much of his free time reading biology books in the library to feed his passion for scientific knowledge. He also had fleeting sporting success, holding down a position in Ormond's First VIII rowing squad for a brief period. He continued to pursue his study of beetles in private, although his classmates found out and there was no loss in this as they viewed his hobby positively. Despite an ongoing shyness, Burnet got on well with staff and students at university. Burnet was self-motivated and often skipped lectures to study at his own faster pace and pursue further knowledge in the library, and he came equal first in physics and chemistry in first year. The following year, 1918, he became increasingly immersed in laboratory work, but he was also dogged by peer pressure to enlist in the , which he saw as a distasteful prospect. However, this was averted by the end of the . In 1919, he was one of 12 high-performing students selected for extra tuition, and he came equal first in third year physiology. He began clinical work in the same year, but found it somewhat unpleasant as he was interested in diagnosing the patient and had little interest in showing empathy towards them.\nWhile at university, he became an  and later an aggressive atheist; he was sceptical of religious faith, which he regarded as \"an effort to believe what common sense tells you isn't true.\" He was also disgusted by what he regarded as hypocritical conduct by religious adherents. Towards the later years of his undergraduate years, his unhappiness with religion began to dog him to a greater extent. He tried to become involved with  for a brief period but then resolved to devote himself to scientific research. The length of time required to study medicine had been reduced to five years to train doctors faster following the outbreak of , and Burnet graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and a Bachelor of Surgery in 1922, ranking second in the final exams despite the death of his father a few weeks earlier. His fellow graduates included , , , Rupert Willis and , who became distinguished scientists in their own right.\nHe then did a ten-month residency at  to gain experience before going into practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under  and , both well known surgeons. He enjoyed this period immensely and was disappointed when he had to do his medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist , whom Burnet came to idolise. As a result of this he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the  was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, who was in charge of such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more suited to a laboratory research career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. Burnet complied.\nDuring the transition period he worked as a pathology registrar at the  and also prepared for his Doctor of Medicine examinations, late in 1923. In 1923 he took up the post of senior resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital; the laboratories were a part of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He conducted research into the  reactions in , leading to his first scientific publications. He decided to work full-time on the  response in , even though he was technically supposed to pursuing  as part of his obligations to the hospital. Burnet came first in the Doctor of Medicine exams by a long distance, and his score was excluded from the scaling process so that the other students would not fail for being so far behind.\nAt the time, the Hall Institute was in the early stages of rapid expansion. The new director of the Institute, , wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in ,  and  that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to Burnet and saw him as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on  in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the  at the  in . Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was free to do his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if  was affected by .\nHe was awarded the  by the Lister Institute in 1926; this gave him enough money for him to resign his curator position and he began full-time research on bacteriophages. He injected mice with bacteriophage and observed their immunological reactions and believed bacteriophages to be . For this work he received a Ph.D. from the  in 1928 under the direction of Professor  and was invited to write a chapter on bacteriophages for the  . He was also given an invitation to deliver a paper at the  in 1927 on the link between O-agglutinins and bacteriophage. Burnet began attending the  functions and befriended some communists, although he refrained from joining them in overt left-wing activism. He also spent his free time enjoying theatre, engaging in amateur  and cycling through continental Europe.\nWhile in London, Burnet became engaged to fellow Australian Edith Linda Marston Druce. She was a secondary school teacher and daughter of a barrister's clerk and the pair had met in 1923 and had a few dates but did not keep in touch. Druce sought out Burnet while on a holiday in London and they quickly agreed to marriage although she had to return to Australia. They married in 1928 after he had completed his Ph.D. and returned to Australia, and had a son and two daughters. At the time, there was a vacancy for the Chair of Bacteriology at the University of London, and Ledingham was lobbying his colleagues to offer Burnet the post, but Burnet returned to Australia, partly because of Druce.\nWhen Burnet returned to Australia, he went back to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, where he was appointed assistant director by Kellaway. His first assignment was to investigate the \"Bundaberg disaster\", in which 12 children had died after receiving a contaminated  vaccine. Kellaway was put in charge of a  to investigate the matter and he put Burnet in charge of the laboratory investigations. He identified  in the toxin- mixture that had been administered to the children; it had been picked up from the skin of one of the children and then transmitted to the others in the injections. However, it turned out to be another toxin that had caused the children's deaths; this work on staphylococcal toxin piqued his interest in immunology. During this time, he continued to study bacteriophages, writing 32 papers on phages between 1924 and 1937. In 1929, Burnet and his graduate assistant Margot McKie wrote a paper suggesting that bacteriophages could exist as a stable non-infectious form that multiplies with the bacterial host. Their pioneering description of  was not accepted until much later, and was crucial to the work of ,  and  on the replication mechanism and genetics of viruses, for which they were awarded the 1969 .\nBetween 1932 and 1933, Burnet took leave of absence to undertake a fellowship at the  in London. The Great Depression had resulted in Burnet's salary being cut from 1000 to 750 pounds, and the National Institute had been given a large grant from the  that allowed them to hire Burnet at 1000 pounds per annum. The National Institute's Director Sir  gained permission from Kellaway for the two-year move; Kellaway promised to hold Burnet's job for him when he returned and felt that the experience would make Burnet\u2014whom he saw as the Hall Institute's brightest young scientist\u2014better equipped to expand operations when he returned to Melbourne. Dale also paid for Burnet's sister to travel to England to help look after her brother's young children.\nSignificant breakthroughs in virology were made while he was there, including the isolation and first demonstration of the transmission of the  virus. His own research was on the , which he used in developing a chick embryo assay for the isolation and quantification of animal viruses. Dale offered Burnet a permanent position but he declined and returned to the Hall Institute. Following his productive work in London, the Rockefeller Institute agreed to fund a new virus research laboratory in Melbourne for Burnet. He brought back a set of viruses from the National Institute to begin the basis of research in Melbourne.\nWhen Burnet returned to Australia, he continued his work on virology, including the  of . He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of  and . After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban in order to prevent human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist , the causative organism of which was named  in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of herpes and Q fever displayed an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his scientific method.\nDuring World War II, Burnet's research moved to  and . With the outbreak of war, Burnet was handed more responsibility and made acting director and had to oversee the move into a new building as Kellaway was seconded to the military in 1939. Due to Kellaway, many of the infectious disease problems afflicting the military were referred to the Institute. Fearing a repeat of the massive global influenza outbreak that occurred after World War I, Burnet focused the Institute in the search for a vaccine. He first tested the vaccine on a group of medical students, and after a promising test on 107 army volunteers in February 1942 following a rise in infections, a large-scale program was introduced two months later to inoculate all new recruits after an influenza A outbreak. In this trial, 20,000 personnel were vaccinated, without success, and the scheme was abandoned. In 1942, the investigations into scrub typhus accelerated after an exodus of researchers in that field from  after the  conquest of the area. However, this ended in tragedy when his collaborator  accidentally injected herself and then died of the infection. Nevertheless, his work on immunisation had earned him international recognition by this time.\nBurnet's first book, , was published in 1940. It had wide influence and was translated into several languages. In 1942 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1944 he travelled to  to deliver the Dunham Lectures. There he was offered a chair, but he refused and returned to Australia. This was attributed to his nationalistic tendencies, as well as his sense of loyalty to the Hall Institute. During his trip he also visited the US military facility at , where he discussed his work on influenza with the scientists working there.\nIn 1944, he was appointed director of the Institute when Kellaway was appointed director of the . Although Kellaway had groomed Burnet to become a pivotal figure, he was hesitant as to whether Burnet would be at his most effective with a strategic leadership role. Kellaway thought that Burnet might not be suited to the post, and should have continued to focus purely on research for the time being. Burnet had similar doubts, particularly given his taciturn nature, but applied for the position anyway. Although he was not known for his social skills, his ability as a scientist and to impart ideas for investigation to his subordinates held his leadership and the Institute in good stead. Unlike his predecessor, who valued a broad gamut of research activities, Burnet was of the opinion that the Institute could not make a significant impact at global level in this way, and he pursued a policy of focusing all effort into one area at a time. Always a strong-willed and rather isolated man, he became more single-minded and less tolerant of criticism of his work and expected a more hierarchical structure and unquestioning obedience. According to biographer Sexton, he \"displayed a kind of territorial protectiveness in relation to his own work\".\nIn 1944, it was decided by the University of Melbourne that Burnet would be appointed a professor as part of a cooperative program so that university students could be experimentally trained at the Institute, while the researchers engaged in some teaching. This was not a success, and there was much tension, as Burnet repeatedly expressed his opinion in public that university teaching and research should be kept separate, at one point leading to a series of open letters from university professors decrying his attitude. Burnet was also not interested in the politics of university funding, and his disengagement from administrative matters engendered resentment. On the other hand, Burnet was vigorous in obtaining funding for the Hall Institute from government bodies, resorting to the bluff of feigning interest in moving overseas to secure continued strong backing. However, he was criticised for being thrifty and refusing to invest in cutting edge equipment, despite the Hall Institute's high standing in research circles. Colleagues believed that he was sceptical of modern technology and thought his outlook to be limiting.\nIn 1946, he initiated the Clinical Research Unit to allow for closer cooperation with the clinical activities of the now named . Despite his known derisive views of clinical science as being inferior, he supported the work enthusiastically.\nUnder Burnet's direction, scientists at the Institute made significant contributions to infectious disease research during a period that has been called the \"golden age of virology\". Virologists including , , , , and  made significant contributions on , , , , herpes and influenza.\nBurnet made significant contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including  assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the  that is secreted by , which later provided the foundation for  significant work on  and the neuraminidase substrate, . Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.\nIn 1957, Burnet decided that research at the Institute should focus on immunology. Burnet reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned and feeling the action was arrogant; for Burnet's part he was comfortable with the decision as he thought it to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the 's . After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on immunological problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to  and the  reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of immunology, immunological surveillance and cancer.\nAt the time, immunology was becoming more sophisticated, with the increasing role of  and . Burnet was suspicious of the direction in which immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude was a factor in his decision to turn the Institute's focus to immunology.\nBurnet began to switch his focus to immunology in the 1940s. In 1941 he wrote a  called \"The Production of Antibodies\", which was revised and reissued in 1949 with Frank Fenner as a co-author. This book is seen as a key publication in immunology\u2014it marks the move from the study of immunology as a chemical endeavour to a biological one. Importantly in this work, he introduced the concept of \"self\" and \"non-self\" to immunology. The distinction between self and non-self was an integral part of Burnet's biological outlook, of his interest in the living organism in its totality, its activities, and interactions. Burnet regarded the \"self\" of the host body as being actively defined during its embryogenesis through complex interactions between immune cells and all the other cells and molecules within an embryo.\nUsing the concept of self, Burnet introduced a hypothesis about the situation where the body failed to make antibodies to its own components () and by extension the idea of . He proposed that\nBurnet was, however, unable to prove this experimentally. ,  and  did find support for Burnet's hypothesis in 1953 when they showed that  could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not from any other mouse strain. Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet and Medawar were able to coordinate their work effectively despite their rather different personalities and physical separation; Burnet was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.\nHowever, later studies showed that cells or tissues transplanted before the immune system development of the recipient, such as in embryonic recipients, could be treated as foreign and trigger rejection, countering Burnet's explanation for self tolerance. In contrast to the Burnet hypothesis of a special tolerance-inducing period defined by the age of the animal,  proposed in 1959, that it is the age of the lymphocyte that defines whether an antigen that is encountered will induce tolerance, with immature lymphocytes being tolerance-sensitive. Lederberg's concept is now known as central tolerance, and is widely accepted. It may also explain the success of some transplants given early in life and the failure to induce tolerance in other studies. Burnet noted that his contributions to immune tolerance were strictly theoretical:\nBurnet was interested in how the body produces antibodies in response to antigens. The dominant idea in the literature through the 1940s was that the antigen acted as a template for antibody production, which was known as the \"instructive\" hypothesis. Burnet was not satisfied with this explanation, and in the second edition of \"The Production of Antibodies\", he and Fenner advanced an indirect template theory which proposed that each antigen could influence the genome, thus effecting the production of antibodies. In 1956 he became interested in 's natural selection hypothesis, which described a mechanism for immune response based on an earlier theory of Nobel-winning immunologist . Jerne proposed that the antigen bound to an antibody by chance and, that upon binding, more antibodies to that antigen would be produced. Burnet developed a model which he named  that expanded on and improved Jerne's hypothesis. Burnet proposed that each  bears on its surface specific immunoglobulins reflecting the specificity of the antibody that will later be synthesised once the cell is activated by an antigen. The antigen serves as a selective stimulus, causing preferential proliferation and differentiation of\nthe clones that have receptors for that antigen.\nIn 1958  and Lederberg showed that one  always produces only one antibody, which was the first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book . His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and  as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.\nThere is some contention over Burnet's publication of his version of the theory in the  in 1957. Some commentators argue he published in an Australian journal to fast-track his hypothesis and obtain priority for his theory over ideas that were published later that year in a paper written by , which Burnet had read prior to its publication. In his paper Burnet cited Talmage's review, and in a later interview, Talmage said he believed that Burnet \"truthfully had developed the idea before he received my paper\". The theory is now sometimes known as Burnet's clonal selection theory, which overlooks the contributions of Ehrlich, Jerne, Talmage, and the contributions of Lederberg, who conceptualised the genetics of clonal selection.\nBurnet's work on graft-versus-host was in collaboration with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this was known as the Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain  in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune . They looked at the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug  to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human autoimmune disease.\nIn 1960, Burnet scaled back his laboratory work, taking one day off per week to concentrate on writing. In 1963, , which he authored with , was published. He also oversaw an expansion of the Hall Institute and secured funding from the  and the state government to build two further floors in the building and take over some of the space taken up by the pathology department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Despite this, Burnet believed that a world class research body needed to be small enough that one person could effectively run it, and maintained tight control over its activities throughout his leadership. He determined the policies himself, and personally selected all of the research staff and students, relying on a small staff to enforce his plans.\nHe continued to be active in the laboratory until his retirement in 1965, although his experimental time began to decrease as the operations became increasingly focused on immunology; Burnet's work in this area had been mostly theoretical. Gustav Nossal became the next director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. Under Burnet's leadership the Institute had become \"probably the world's best known research centre devoted to the study of immunology.\" However, with the increasing sophistication in medical science and its reliance on more complicated technology, Burnet's lone-wolf approach became less compatible with the research environment, which required more collaboration. In his final years at the helm, Burnet allowed more technical modernisation during the transition period to Nossal's leadership.\nFrom 1937 Burnet was involved in a variety of scientific and public policy bodies, starting with a position on a government advisory council on polio. After he became the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1944, he was considered a public figure and overcame shyness to become a good public speaker. He recognised the importance of co-operation with the media if the general public was to understand science and scientists, and his writings and lectures played an important part in the formulation of public attitudes and policy in Australia on a variety of biological topics. However, despite making many appearances on radio and television, he never became at ease with interviews and had to be selective with outreach engagements due to the many invitations he received, and tended to accept those that had the potential to promote the Institute. Over time, he began to increase his activism, as he felt more confident that he would be able to make an impact as his reputation grew, especially after winning the Nobel Prize, and even more so after his retirement from the directorship of the Institute. Although Burnet was not naturally outgoing, he saw it as the social responsibility of a scientific leader and scholar to publicly speak out and impart wisdom and foresight to the wider community.\nBurnet served as a member or chairman of scientific committees, both in Australia and overseas. Between 1947 and 1953, he was a member of the 's Medical Research Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for medical research in Australia. During this same period (1947\u201352), he was also a member of the  Defence Research and Development Policy Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that Burnet made the recommendation that Australia pursue development of  and  to target neighbouring countries' food stocks and spread infectious diseases. His report was titled . Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; he was concerned that Australians were being exposed to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.\nInternationally, Burnet was a chairman of the Papua New Guinea Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1962 and 1969. At the time, Papua New Guinea was an Australian territory, and Burnet had first travelled there as his son was posted there. His role on the committee allowed him to explore his interest in . He was particularly interested in  (laughing sickness), and lobbied the Australian government to establish the Papua New Guinea Institute of Human Biology. Burnet later helped oversee the institute's contribution to the Anglo-Australian participation in the International Biological Programme in the Field of Human Adaptability.\nBurnet served as first chair for the  (1966\u201369), a Commonwealth initiative to foster interaction between the member countries' elite, and he was also active in the , serving on the Expert Advisory Panels on Virus Diseases and on Immunology between 1952 and 1969 and the World Health Organization Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1969 and 1973.\nIn 1964, he was appointed to sit on the University Council of Victoria's third university  on an interim basis until the institution was formed in 1966. He served until 1970. He advocated a less hierarchical relationship between a professor and student, something seen as a move away from the English tradition prevalent in Australia towards an American model. He also called for the downgrading of the importance placed on the liberal arts. His ideas were too radical for his peers and he stepped down from the role in 1970 after none of his suggestions had made an impact.\nBurnet was opposed to the use of nuclear power in Australia owing to the issues of . He later retracted his objections to , feeling that nuclear power was necessary while other renewable energy sources were being developed. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he was also vocal in the anti-smoking movement; he was one of the first high-profile figures in Australia to educate the public on the dangers of tobacco, and he appeared in a television advertisement criticising the ethics of , and broadcasters for displaying such material. He and fellow activists were surprised that the commercial was allowed to run briefly, before being taken off air by the station, which only further generated attention for the anti-smoking campaign. A former smoker, he had rejected the habit in the 1950s after several friends died. Burnet was also a critic of the  and called for the creation of an international police force.\nFollowing his resignation from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an office at the  in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books on a variety of topics including immunology, ageing and cancer, and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled , which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He was known for his ability to write quickly, often without a final draft, and his ability to convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had much influence. In 1969 he published , considered his magnum opus on immunity, which attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the clonal selection theory. The following year, he wrote , which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused work schedule, often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.\nHe became president of the  in 1965, having been a foundational fellow when the Academy was formed in 1954. He had been offered the presidency in 1958 to replace the inaugural head Sir , but declined, although he served on the council and as vice president in 1961\u201363. As president he was recognised by both government and the public as the leading scientist in Australia. His stature as a scientist gave him the gravitas to end policy disputes, and gave the Academy and its advocacy more credibility in the eyes of government and industry. As such his term was considered to be highly successful. Oliphant said that Burnet's personal prestige was very important in the increased respect the AAS won and that he \"made the biological sciences far more acceptable in Australia\".\nHe helped establish the Academy's Science and Industry Forum, which was formed in the second year of his leadership in order to improve dialogue between researchers and industrialists. It investigated whether a national science policy should be formulated and led to the eventual creation of the . He also laid the foundations of the . When his presidency ended in 1969, the Academy founded the , which is the Academy's highest award for biological sciences.\nAs in many of his previous pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group of the scientific community and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful due to a lack of concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members\u2014such as Burnet\u2014being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.\nIn 1966, Burnet accepted a nomination from Australia Prime Minister Sir  to become the inaugural chairman of the , a body that aimed to increase the professional interchange between the various nations of the . Burnet served in the role for three years and helped start it on a path of steady growth, although he was unable to use it as a personal platform to  espouse the importance of human biology.\nBurnet's essays and books published in his later life caused contention within the scientific community and to the chagrin of his peers Burnet often made pessimistic proclamations about the future of science. In 1966 Burnet wrote an opinion article for  entitled \"Men or Molecules?\" in which he questioned the usefulness of , arguing that it had not and would not contribute anything of use to medicine and that manipulation of the genome as had been demonstrated in bacteria would do more harm to humans than good. Gustav Nossal subsequently described Burnet as \"a biologist with a love-hate affair with biochemistry, which led to a brief but damaging rejection of the worth of molecular biology.\"\nHe delivered the inaugural Oscar Mendelsohn lecture in 1971 at  and advocated policies for Australia such as population control, prevention of war, long-term plans for the management of the environment and natural resources, Aboriginal land rights, socialism, recycling, advertising bans on socially harmful products, and more regulation of the environment. He angrily denounced French nuclear testing in the Pacific, and after consistently voting for the ruling Liberal Party coalition as it ruled for the past few decades, signed an open letter backing the opposition Labor Party of , which took power in 1972. However, he soon spoke out against Whitlam's lack of action against tobacco advertising and French nuclear tests. Burnet often found himself frustrated with the refusal of politicians to base policy on long-term objectives, such as the sustainability of human life.\nIn 1971\u201372, he wrote four books, most notably, , which caused great controversy due to its strident attacks on molecular biology, cellular biology, and claims that cancer and various other diseases were incurable and that it was pointless to try to do so. He also predicted that scientific progress would end soon.\nBurnet spoke and wrote widely on the topic of human biology after his retirement, aiming to reach all strata of society. He courted the media as well as the scientific community, often leading to sensationalist or scientifically unrigorous report of his outspoken views. This often angered colleagues, who viewed him as abusing his stature to deliberately cause a stir.  In 1966 Burnet presented the , focusing on human biology. He provided a conceptual framework for sustainable development; 21 years later the definition provided by the  was almost identical. In 1970 he revised an earlier book which was published as ; it was followed by , which was published in 1978. The books discuss aspects of human biology, a topic which Burnet wrote on extensively in his later years. In  he argued that the roots of all human behaviour can be found in the behaviour of animals; in  he addressed issues of ageing, life, death and the future of mankind. The books strongly polarised the scientific community, and one reviewer described his ideas of sociobiology as \"extreme\" and giving \"a dismal, unappealing view of humanity\". In , he also called for society to accept euthanasia of ill older people, repeat violent criminals, and most controversially, abortion of pregnancies likely to result in disabled children, and infanticide of handicapped newborns. Knowing that there would be a strong backlash for such policies, he departed overseas for a two-month lecture series at the time of the book launch. In his absence, he was strongly assailed in newspaper letters and some correspondents compared his stance on infanticide to that of . At the same time, he also changed his stance on nuclear power and advocated its use, and the reinvestment of revenue for research into solar power. This about face angered the environmental movement.\nHis first wife, Edith Linda Druce, died from lymphoid leukaemia in 1973, after a four-year struggle. During her final years, Burnet refused all offers of lectures overseas to spend more time nursing his ailing wife. For a period after this he became very lethargic and reclusive, numbed by his wife's death. He then moved into Ormond College for company, and resumed beetle collecting, but for a year after her death, Burnet tried to alleviate his grief by writing mock letters to her once a week. Gradually he regained his enthusiasm and began writing again. In 1975, he travelled to California to deliver a series of lectures. In 1976 he married Hazel G. Jenkins, a widowed former singer from a business family in her 70s who was working in the microbiology department as a librarian, and moved out of Ormond College.\nIn 1978 Burnet decided to officially retire; in retirement he wrote two books. During this time, he missed his laboratory work, and he was constrained to social events and theorising. In 1982, Burnet was one of three contributors to , writing about genetic issues and their impact on the nation's impact. As a result of the success of the book, in early 1983, Burnet was appointed to the 70-person Australian Advisory Council of Elders to offer counsel to policymakers, but the group folded after several members became too frail or died.\nBurnet continued to travel and speak, but in the early 1980s, he and his wife became increasingly hampered by illness. Having surmised his illness two years earlier, in November 1984 he underwent surgery for . He made plans to resume scientific meetings, but was then taken ill again, with significant pain in his thorax and legs. Secondary lesions were found in June 1985 and declared to be inoperable and terminal. A supporter of euthanasia, Burnet was unfazed by his imminent death, and he died on 31 August at his son's home at  after two months' of illness. He was given a state funeral by the government of Australia; many of his distinguished colleagues from the Hall Institute such as Nossal and Fenner were pall-bearers, and he was buried near his paternal grandparents after a private family service at  in Koroit, near Port Fairy. Following his death he was honoured by the ; Prime Minister  took the highly unusual step of moving a condolence motion, an honour typically reserved for parliamentarians. Lady Hazel Burnet died in 1990.\nBurnet received extensive honours for his contributions to science and public life during his lifetime. He was  in the , received the Elizabeth II Coronation Medal in 1953, and was appointed to the  (OM) in the 1958 . In 1960 he was the first recipient of the honorary  award. He received a Gold and Silver Star from the Japanese  in 1961.  He was appointed  (KBE) in the , and received the Elizabeth II Jubilee Medal in 1977. In 1978 he was made a  (AK). He was only the fourth person to receive this honour.\nHe was a fellow or honorary member of 30 international Academies of Sciences. He received 10 honorary  degrees from universities including Cambridge, Harvard and Oxford, an honorary  degree from Hahnemann Medical College (now part of ), an honorary Doctor of Medical Science from the  and a  degree from the University of Melbourne. Including his Nobel, he received 19 medals or awards including the  and the  from the Royal Society and the ; he also received 33 international lectureships and 17 lectureships within Australia.\nAfter his death, Australia's largest communicable diseases research institute\u2014the  was renamed in his honour. The Burnet Clinical Research Unit of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute was also named in his honour in 1986. In 1975 his work on immunology was recognised by a 33-cent stamp released by . Seven Australian medical scientists were commemorated in the issue of a set of four Australian stamps released in 1995; he appears on the 45-cent stamp with fellow University of Melbourne graduate . He also appears on a  stamp that was issued in 1997. The centenary of his birth was celebrated in Australia in 1999; a statue of him was erected in Franklin Street, Traralgon; and several events were held in his honour including the release of a new edition of  by Oxford University Press.\nBurnet biographer Christopher Sexton suggests that Burnet's legacy is fourfold: (1) the scope and quality of his research; (2) his nationalistic attitude which led him to stay in Australia, leading to the development of science in Australia and inspiring future generations of Australian scientists; (3) his success establishing the reputation of Australian medical research worldwide; and (4) his books, essays and other writings. In spite of his sometimes controversial ideas on science and humanity,  has noted that \"Burnet's reputation is secure in his achievements as an experimentalist, a theoretician and a leader of the Australian scientific community.\"\n\n\n"},

He initially attended Warrnambool High School (now ) (where a science wing is named in his honour), then completed his final year of schooling at . Aged 17, he was awarded a senior scholarship to study medicine at the . As a medical undergraduate, he was never able to find a satisfactory explanation for the interaction of mind and body; he started to think about becoming a neuroscientist. He graduated (with first class honours) in 1925, and was awarded a  to study under  at , , where he received his Doctor of Philosophy in 1929.\nIn 1937 Eccles returned to Australia, where he worked on military research during . During this time Eccles was the director of Kanematsu Institute at , he and  gave research lectures at the , strongly influencing its intellectual environment. After the war, he became a professor at the  in New Zealand. From 1952 to 1962 he worked as a professor at the  (JCSMR) of the . The Eccles Institute of Neuroscience is headquartered in a new wing of the JCSMR building, constructed with the assistance of a $63M grant from the Commonwealth Government and completed in March 2012.\nIn the early 1950s, Eccles and his colleagues performed the research that would lead to his receiving the Nobel Prize. To study synapses in the peripheral nervous system, Eccles and colleagues used the stretch reflex as a model, which is easily studied because it consists of only two : a sensory neuron (the  fibre) and the . The sensory neuron synapses onto the motor neuron in the . When a current is passed into the sensory neuron in the , the motor neuron innervating the quadriceps produced a small  (EPSP). When a similar current is passed through the , the opposing muscle to the quadriceps, an  (IPSP) is produced in the quadriceps motor neuron. Although a single EPSP was not enough to fire an  in the motor neuron, the sum of several EPSPs from multiple sensory neurons synapsing onto the motor neuron can cause the motor neuron to fire, thus contracting the quadriceps. On the other hand, IPSPs could subtract from this sum of EPSPs, preventing the motor neuron from firing.\nApart from these seminal experiments, Eccles was key to a number of important developments in . Until around 1949, Eccles believed that  was primarily electrical rather than chemical. Although he was wrong in this hypothesis, his arguments led him and others to perform some of the experiments which proved chemical synaptic transmission.  and Eccles worked together on some of the experiments which elucidated the role of  as a  in the brain.\nHe was appointed a  in 1958 in recognition of services to physiological research.\nHe won the  Award in 1963, the same year he won the Nobel Prize.\nIn 1964 he became an honorary member to the , and in 1966 he moved to the United States to work at the  in Chicago. Unhappy with the working conditions there, he left to become a professor at the  from 1968 until he retired in 1975. After retirement, he moved to Switzerland and wrote on the .\nIn 1981, Eccles became a founding member of the .\nIn 1990 he was appointed a  of the  (AC) in recognition of service to science, particularly in the field of neurophysiology. He died in 1997 in , , Switzerland.\nIn  (1973), Eccles summarises his philosophy: \"Now before discussing brain function in detail I will at the beginning give an account of my philosophical position on the so-called 'brain-mind problem' so that you will be able to relate the experimental evidence to this philosophical position. I have written at length on this philosophy in my book . In Fig. 6-1 you will be able to see that I fully accept the recent philosophical achievements of  with his concept of three worlds. I was a , now I am a ! Cartesian dualism has become unfashionable with many people. They embrace  to escape the enigma of brain-mind interaction with its perplexing problems. But Sir Karl Popper and I are , and what is more, ! The three worlds are very easily defined. I believe that in the classification of Fig. 6-1 there is nothing left out. It takes care of everything that is in existence and in our experience. All can be classified in one or other of the categories enumerated under Worlds 1, 2 and 3.\n\n\"In Fig. 6-1, World 1 is the world of physical objects and states. It comprises the whole cosmos of matter and energy, all of biology including human brains, and all artifacts that man has made for coding information, as for example, the paper and ink of books or the material base of works of art. World 1 is the total world of the materialists. They recognise nothing else. All else is fantasy.\n\"World 2 is the world of states of consciousness and subjective knowledge of all kinds. The totality of our perceptions comes in this world. But there are several levels. In agreement with Polten, I tend to recognise three kinds of levels of World 2, as indicated in Fig. 6-2, but it may be more correct to think of it as a spectrum.\nFIG. 6-2, World of Consciousness\n\"The first level (outer sense) would be the ordinary perceptions provided by all our sense organs, hearing and touch and sight and smell and pain. All of these perceptions are in World 2, of course: vision with light and colour; sound with music and harmony; touch with all its qualities and vibration; the range of odours and tastes, and so on. These qualities do not exist in World 1, where correspondingly there are but electromagnetic waves, pressure waves in the atmosphere, material objects, and chemical substances.\n\"In addition there is a level of , which is the world of more subtle perceptions. It is the world of your emotions, of your feelings of joy and sadness and fear and anger and so on. It includes all your memory, and all your imaginings and planning into the future. In fact there is a whole range of levels which could be described at length. All the subtle experiences of the human person are in this inner sensory world. It is all private to you but you can reveal it in linguistic expression, and by gestures of all levels of subtlety.\n\"Finally, at the core of World 2 there is the  or , which is the basis of our unity as an experiencing being throughout our whole lifetime.\n\"This World 2 is our . Our conscious experiences are the basis of our knowledge of World 1, which is thus a world of , a derivative world. Whenever I am doing a scientific experiment, for example, I have to plan it cognitively, all in my thoughts, and then consciously carry out my plan of action in the experiment. Finally I have to look at the results and evaluate them in thought. For example, I have to see the traces of the oscilloscope and their photographic records or hear the signals on the loudspeaker. The various signals from the recording equipment have to be received by my sense organs, transmitted to my brain, and so to my consciousness, then appropriately measured and compared before I can begin to think about the significance of the experimental results. We are all the time, in every action we do, incessantly playing backwards and forwards between World 1 and World 2.\n\"And what is World 3? As shown in Fig. 6-1 it is the whole world of culture. It is the world that was created by man and that reciprocally made man. This is my message in which I follow Popper unreservedly. The whole of language is here. All our means of communication, all our intellectual efforts coded in books, coded in the artistic and technological treasures in the museums, coded in every artefact left by man from primitive times\u2014this is World 3 right up to the present time. It is the world of civilisation and culture. Education is the means whereby each human being is brought into relation with World 3. In this manner he becomes immersed in it throughout life, participating in the heritage of mankind and so becoming fully human. World 3 is the world that uniquely relates to man. It is the world which is completely unknown to animals. They are blind to all of World 3. I say that without any reservations. This is then the first part of my story.\n\"Now I come to consider the way in which the three worlds interact...\"\nDespite these words, in his late book , Eccles proposed a dualistic mechanism of mind.\nEccles had nine children. Eccles married Irene Miller Eccles (1904-2002) in 1928 and divorced in 1968. After his divorce in 1968, Eccles married Helena T\u00e1bor\u00edkov\u00e1; a fellow neuropsychologist and M.D. of Charles University. The two often collaborated in research and they remained married until his death. Eccles died on 2 May 1997 in his home of . He was buried in Contra, Switzerland.\n"},

In 1973 he was awarded the , \"for an epic and psychological narrative art which has introduced a new continent into literature\", as it says in the Swedish Academy's citation, the only Australian to have been awarded the prize. White was also the inaugural recipient of the .\nWhite was born in , London, to Victor Martindale White and Ruth (n\u00e9e Withycombe), both Australians, in their apartment overlooking  on 28 May 1912. His family returned to Sydney, Australia, when he was six months old. As a child he lived in a flat with his sister, a nanny, and a maid while his parents lived in an adjoining flat.  In 1916 they moved to a house in  that many years later became a nursing home, Lulworth House, the residents of which included , , and White's partner .\nAt the age of four, White developed asthma, a condition that had taken the life of his maternal grandfather. White's health was fragile throughout his childhood, which precluded his participation in many childhood activities.\nHe loved the theatre, which he first visited at an early age (his mother took him to see  at the age of six). This love was expressed at home when he performed private rites in the garden and danced for his mother's friends.\nAt the age of five, he attended kindergarten at Sandtoft in , in Sydney's .\nAt the age of ten, White was sent to , a boarding school in  in the  of New South Wales, in an attempt to abate his asthma. It took him some time to adjust to the presence of other children. At boarding school, he started to write plays. Even at this early age, White wrote about palpably adult themes. In 1924, the boarding school ran into financial trouble, and the headmaster suggested for White to be sent to a  in England, a suggestion that his parents accepted.\nWhite struggled to adjust to his new surroundings at , England. He later described it as \"a four-year prison sentence\". White withdrew socially and had a limited circle of acquaintances. Occasionally, he would holiday with his parents at European locations, but their relationship remained distant. However he did spend time with his cousin Jack Withycombe during this period, and Jack's daughter  became a mentor to him while he was writing his first book of poems,  between the years 1927\u201329.\nWhile at school in London, White made one close friend, Ronald Waterall, an older boy who shared similar interests. White's biographer, , wrote that \"the two men would walk, arm-in-arm, to London shows; and stand around stage doors crumbing for a glimpse of their favourite stars, giving a practical demonstration of a chorus girl's high kick... with appropriate vocal accompaniment\". When Waterall left school, White withdrew again. He asked his parents if he could leave school to become an actor. The parents compromised and allowed him to finish school early if he came home to Australia to try life on the land. His parents felt that he should work on the land rather than become a writer and hoped that his work as a  would temper his artistic ambitions.\nWhite spent two years working as a  at Bolaro, a 73-square-kilometre (28\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) station near , on the edge of the , in southeastern Australia. Although he grew to respect the land and his health improved, it was clear that he was not cut out for this life.\nFrom 1932 to 1935, White lived in England, studying French and German literature at , . During his time at Cambridge he developed a romantic attraction to a young man who had come to King's College to become an Anglican priest. White dared not speak of his feelings for fear of losing the friendship and, like many other gay men of that period, he feared that his sexuality would doom him to a lonely life. Then, one night, the student priest, after an awkward liaison with two women, admitted to White that women meant nothing to him sexually. That became White's first love affair.\nDuring White's time at Cambridge he published a collection of poetry entitled , and wrote a play named , which was later performed by an amateur group (which included his sister Suzanne) at the tiny  in Sydney. After being admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1935, White briefly settled in London, where he lived in an area that was frequented by artists. There, the young author thrived creatively for a time, writing several unpublished works and reworking , a novel that he had written while jackarooing. In 1937, White's father died, leaving him ten thousand pounds in inheritance. The fortune enabled him to write full-time in relative comfort. Two more plays followed before he succeeded in finding a publisher for . The novel was received well in London but poorly in Australia. He began writing another novel, , but abandoned it before its completion after receiving negative comments, a decision that he later admitted regretting.\nIn 1936, White met the painter , 18 years his senior, who became an important influence in his life and work. The two men never became lovers but remained firm friends. In White's own words, \"He became what I most needed, an intellectual and aesthetic mentor\". They had many similarities: they were both gay and they both felt like outsiders in their own families; as a result they both had ambivalent feelings about their families and backgrounds, yet both maintained close and lifelong links with their families, particularly their mothers. They also both appreciated the benefits of social standing and connections and Christian symbolism and biblical themes are common in both artists' work.\nWhite dedicated his first novel  to De Maistre and acknowledged De Maistre's influence on his writing. In 1947, De Maistre's painting  was used as the cover for the first edition of White's . White bought many of De Maistre's paintings. In 1974 White gave all his paintings by De Maistre to the .\nTowards the end of the 1930s, White spent time in the United States, including , Massachusetts, and , which were artistic hotbeds at the time, where he wrote . By the time World War II broke out, he had returned to London and joined the British . He was accepted as an intelligence officer, and was posted to the Middle East. He served in Egypt, Palestine, and Greece before the war was over. While in the Middle East, he had an affair with a Greek army officer, , who was to become his life partner.\nWhite and Lascaris lived together in Cairo for six years before moving to a small farm purchased by White at , near Sydney, in 1948. After the death of White's mother in 1963, they moved into a large house, , in , where they lived for the rest of their lives.\nAfter the war, White once again returned to Australia, buying an old house in , now a Sydney suburb but then semi-rural. He named the house \"The Dogwoods,\" after trees he planted there. In this house, he settled down with Lascaris, the Greek he had met during the war. They lived there for 18 years, selling flowers, vegetables, milk, and cream as well as pedigreed puppies. During these years he started to make a reputation for himself as a writer, publishing  and  in the United States in 1955 and shortly after in the United Kingdom.  was released to rave reviews in the United States, but in what had become a typical pattern, it was panned in Australia. White had doubts about whether to continue writing after his books were largely dismissed in Australia (three of them having been called 'un-Australian' by critics), but, in the end, he decided to persevere. His first breakthrough in Australia came when his next novel, , won the inaugural .\nIn 1961, White published . It was to become both a bestseller and a prizewinner, gaining him a second Miles Franklin Award. In 1963, White and Lascaris decided to sell the house at Castle Hill. A number of White's works from the 1960s depict the fictional town of Sarsaparilla, including his collection of short stories, , and the play, . By now, he had clearly established his reputation as one of the world's great authors, but remained an essentially private person, resisting opportunities for interviews and public appearances although his circle of friends had widened significantly.\nIn 1968, White wrote , a searing character portrait of an artist. Many people drew links to the Sydney painter  (1904\u201384) and White's friend, the painter , but White denied the connections. Patrick White was an art collector who had, as a young man, been deeply impressed by his friends  and , and later said he wished he had been an artist.  By the mid-1960s, he had also become interested in encouraging dozens of young and less established artists, such as , , and . White was later friends with , the young star of Australian painting, in the 1970s. That friendship ended when White felt that Whiteley, a heroin addict, was deceitful and pushy about selling his paintings. A portrait of White by  won the 1962 .\nWhite decided not to accept any more prizes for his work, and he declined both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by  to work on a screenplay for  but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia's decision to participate in the . His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the , but in 1971, after losing to , he wrote to a friend: .\nNevertheless, in 1973, White did accept the Nobel Prize \"for an epic and psychological narrative art, which has introduced a new continent into literature\". His cause was said to have been championed by a Scandinavian diplomat resident in Australia. White enlisted Nolan to travel to Stockholm to accept the prize on his behalf. The award had an immediate impact on his career, as his publisher doubled the print run for  and gave him a larger advance for his next novel. White used the money from the prize to establish a trust to fund the , given annually to established creative writers who have received little public recognition. He was invited by the  to be seated on the floor of the House in recognition of his achievement. White declined, explaining that his nature could not easily adapt itself to such a situation. The last time such an invitation had been extended was in 1928, to .\nWhite was made  for 1974, but in a typically rebellious fashion, his acceptance speech encouraged Australians to spend the day reflecting on the state of the country. Privately, he was less than enthusiastic about it. In a letter to Marshall Best on 27 January 1974, he wrote: \"Something terrible happened to me last week. There is an organisation which chooses an Australian of the Year, who has to appear at an official lunch in  on . This year I was picked on as they had run through all the swimmers, tennis players, yachtsmen\".\nWhite and Lascaris hosted many dinner parties at Highbury, their Centennial Park home, in a leafy part of the affluent Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. In , his biographer  portrays White as a genial host but one who easily fell out with friends.\nWhite supported the conservative, business oriented  until the election of 's  government and, following the , he became particularly , making a rare appearance on national television to broadcast his views on the matter. White also publicly expressed his admiration for the historian , satirist , and unionist .\nDuring the 1970s, White's health began to deteriorate: his teeth were crumbling, his eyesight was failing, and he had chronic lung problems - however, he also became a more openly political person, and began sometimes commenting on current issues. He was among the first group of Companions of the  in 1975 but resigned in June 1976 in protest at the dismissal of the Whitlam government in November 1975 by the Governor-General Sir . In 1979, his novel  was shortlisted for the , but White requested that it to be removed to give younger writers a chance to win. (The prize was won by , who ironically was just four years younger than White.) Soon after, White announced that he had written his last novel, and from then on, he would write only for radio or the stage.\nDirector  introduced himself to White while walking down a Sydney street, some time after White had seen a politically loaded stage revue by Sharman, , which had been panned by Sydney newspaper critics, and had written a letter to the editor of a newspaper defending the show. White felt somewhat cautious at first, not least due to the gulf in age between them, but after a while the two men became friends and Sharman and his theatrical circle, as well as his visual style as a director, would inspire White to a couple of new plays, notably  with its satirical portrayal of a posh and vulgar upper-class Sydney society. A few years later, Sharman asked White if he could make a film of . White agreed and wrote the screenplay for the film.\nIn 1981, White published his autobiography, , which explored issues about which he had publicly said little such as his homosexuality, his dislike of the \"subservient\" attitude of Australian society towards Britain and the Royal family, and also the distance he had felt towards his mother. On , 1982, White addressed a crowd of 30,000 people, calling for a ban on  and for the destruction of .\nIn 1986 White released one last novel, , but it was published under the pen name \"Alex Xenophon Demirjian Gray\" with White named as editor. In the same year,  was turned into , with music by  and the libretto adapted by . White refused to see it when it was first performed at the , because  had been invited, and chose instead to see it later in Sydney. In 1987, White wrote , with his musings on ageing and society's efforts to achieve aesthetic perfection. When David Marr finished his biography of White in July 1990, his subject spent nine days going over the details with him.\nWhite died in Sydney on 30 September 1990.\nIn 2009, The Sydney Theatre Company staged White's play . In 2010 White received posthumous recognition for his novel , which was shortlisted for the  for 1970.\nIn 2011 Fred Schepisi's  of  was released with screenplay adaptation by ,  playing the son Basil,  as the daughter Dorothy, and  as the dying matriarch Elizabeth Hunter. This is the first screen realisation of a White novel, fittingly the one that played a key role in the Swedish panel's choice of White as Nobel prize winner.\nIn 1970, White was offered a knighthood but declined it.\nBoth White and  were members of the first group of six people appointed  (AC) in the civil division, (now called the general division).

It has been claimed that the  theory was ridiculed by established scientists and doctors, who did not believe that any bacteria could live in the acidic environment of the stomach.

The first 30 out of 100 samples showed no support for their hypothesis. However, it was discovered that the lab technicians had been throwing out the cultures after 2 days. This was standard practice for throat swabs where other organisms in the mouth rendered cultures as not useful after 2 days. Due to other hospital work, the lab technicians did not have time to immediately throw out the 31st test on the second day, and so it stayed from Thursday through to the Monday.

For this work, she was awarded the 2009 , sharing it with Greider and , becoming the first Australian woman Nobel laureate. She also worked in , and was controversially dismissed from the  Administration's .\n\nElizabeth Helen Blackburn, one of seven children, was born in , , on 26 November 1948 to parents who were both family physicians. Her family moved to the city of  when she was four, where she attended the Broadland House Church of England Girls' Grammar School (later amalgamated with ) until the age of sixteen. Upon her family's relocation to , she attended , and ultimately gained very high marks in the end-of-year final statewide matriculation exams. She went on to earn a  in 1970 and  in 1972, both from the  in the field of biochemistry. Blackburn then went to receive her  in 1975 from the , where she worked with Frederick Sanger developing methods to sequence DNA using RNA, as well as studying the bacteriophage . It was also here, the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge University, where Blackburn met her husband John Sedat. Blackburn's soon to be husband had taken a position at Yale, where she then decided to finish her postdoctoral. \u201cThus it was that love brought me to a most fortunate and influential choice: Joe Gall\u2019s lab at Yale.\u201d\nDuring her postdoctoral work at Yale, Blackburn was doing research on the protozoan  and noticed a repeating  at the end of the linear rDNA which varied in size Blackburn then noticed that this hexanucleotide at the end of the chromosome contained a TTAGGG sequence that was , and the terminal end of the chromosomes were palindromic. These characteristics allowed Blackburn and colleagues to conduct further research on the protozoan. Using the telomeric repeated end of , Blackburn and colleague Jack Szostak showed the unstable replicating plasmids of yeast were protected from degradation, proving that these sequences contained characteristics of telomeres. This research also proved the telomeric repeats of  were conserved evolutionarily between the species. Through this research, Blackburn and collaborators noticed the replication system for chromosomes was not likely to add to the lengthening of the telomere, and that the addition of these hexanucleotides to the chromosomes was likely due to the activity of an enzyme that is able to transfer specific functional groups. The proposition of a possible transferase-like enzyme led Blackburn and PhD student Carol W. Greider to the discovery of an enzyme with reverse transcriptase activity that was able to fill in the terminal ends of telomeres without leaving the chromosome incomplete and unable to divide without loss of the end of the chromosome. This 1985 discovery led to the purification of this enzyme in lab, showing the transferase-like enzyme contained both RNA and protein components. The RNA portion of the enzyme served as a template for adding the telomeric repeats to the incomplete telomere, and the protein added enzymatic function for the addition of these repeats.Through this breakthrough, the term \u201ctelomerase\u201d was given to the enzyme, solving the end-replication process that had troubled scientists at the time.\n works by adding base pairs to the overhang of DNA on the 3\u2019 end, extending the strand until DNA polymerase and an RNA primer can complete the complementary strand and successfully synthesize the double stranded DNA. Since DNA polymerase only synthesizes DNA in the leading strand direction, the shortening of the telomere results. Through their research, Blackburn and collaborators were able to show that the telomere is effectively replenished by the enzyme telomerase, which conserves cellular division by preventing the rapid loss of genetic information internal to the telomere, leading to cellular aging.\n\n\nOn January 1, 2016, Blackburn was interviewed about her studies, discovering telomerase, and her current research. When she was asked to recall the moment of telomerase discovery she stated:In 1978, Blackburn joined the faculty of the , in the Department of Molecular Biology. In 1990, she moved across the San Francisco Bay to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the  (UCSF), where she served as the Department Chair from 1993 to 1999 and was the Morris Herzstein Professor of Biology and Physiology at UCSF. Blackburn became a Professor Emeritus at UCSF at the end of 2015.\nBlackburn, co-founded the company Telomere Health which offers telomere length testing to the public, but later severed ties with the company.\nIn 2015, Elizabeth Blackburn was announced as the new President of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. \u201cFew scientists garner the kind of admiration and respect that Dr. Blackburn receives from her peers for her scientific accomplishments and her leadership, service and integrity,\u201d says Irwin M. Jacobs, chairman of Salk's Board of Trustees, on Blackburn's appointment as President of the Institute. \u201cHer deep insight as a scientist, her vision as a leader, and her warm personality will prove invaluable as she guides the Salk Institute on its continuing journey of discovery.\u201d \u00a0In 2017, she announced her plans to retire from the Salk Institute the following year.\nFor their research and contributions to the understanding of telomeres and the enzyme telomerase, Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider, and Jack Szostaks were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The substantial research on the effects of chromosomal protection from telomerase, and the impact this has on cellular division has been a revolutionary catalyst in the field of molecular biology. For example, the addition of telomerase to cells that do not possess this enzyme has shown to bypass the limit of cellular aging in those cells, thereby linking this enzyme to reduced cellular aging. The addition of telomerase, and the presence of the enzyme in cancer cells has been shown to provide an immunity mechanism for the cell in proliferating, linking the transferase activity to increased cellular growth and reduced sensitivity for cellular signalling. The importance of discovering this enzyme has since sent led her continued research at the University of California San Francisco, where she studies the effect of telomeres and telomerase activity on cellular aging.\nBlackburn was appointed a member of the  in 2002. She supported human embryonic cell research, in opposition to the Bush Administration. Her Council terms were terminated by  directive on 27 February 2004. Dr. Blackburn believes that she was dismissed from the Council due to her disapproval of the Bush administration's position against stem cell research. This was followed by expressions of outrage over her removal by many scientists, 170 of whom signed an open letter to the president maintaining that she was fired because of political opposition to her advice.\nScientists and ethicists at the time even went as far to say that Blackburn's removal was in violation of Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which \u201crequires balance on such advisory bodies\u201d\n\"There is a growing sense that scientific research\u2014which, after all, is defined by the quest for truth\u2014is being manipulated for political ends,\" wrote Blackburn. \"There is evidence that such manipulation is being achieved through the stacking of the membership of advisory bodies and through the delay and misrepresentation of their reports.\"\nBlackburn serves on the Science Advisory Board of the Regenerative Medicine Foundation formerly known as the Genetics Policy Institute.\nBlackburn's first book  (2017) was co-authored with  Dr. Elissa Epel of Aging, Metabolism, and Emotions (AME) Center at the UCSF Center for Health and Community. Blackburn comments on aging reversal and care for one's telomeres through lifestyle: managing chronic stress, exercising, eating better and getting enough sleep; telomere testing, plus cautions and advice. While studying telomeres and the replenishing enzyme, telomerase, Blackburn discovered a vital role played by these protective caps that revolved around one central idea: aging of cells. The book hones in on many of the effects that poor health can have on telomeres and telomerase activity. Since telomeres shorten with every division of a cell, replenishing these caps is essential to long term cell growth. Through research and data, Blackburn explained that people that lead stressful lives exhibit less telomerase functioning in the body, which leads to a decrease in the dividing capabilities of the cell. Once telomeres shorten drastically, the cells can no longer divide, meaning the tissues they replenish with every division would therefore die out, highlighting the aging mechanism in humans. To increase telomerase activity in people with stress-filled lives, Blackburn suggests moderate exercise, even 15 minutes a day, which has been proven to stimulate telomerase activity and replenish the telomere.\nBlackburn also states that unhappiness in lives also has an effect on the shortening of telomeres. In a study done on divorced couples, their telomere length was \"significantly shorter\" compared to couples in healthy relationships, and Blackburn states, \"There's an obvious stressor... we are intensely social beings.\" She suggests to include positivity into our daily lives to increase health as well. While increasing the amount of exercise, decreasing stress, tobacco use, and maintaining a balanced sleep schedule, Blackburn explains that our telomeres can be drastically maintained and prevented from rapid shortening, leading to a decrease in the aging process of our cells. Blackburn also tells the readers to be wary of clinical pills who proclaim to lengthen or telomeres and protect the body from aging. She says that these pills and creams have no scientific proof of being anti-aging supplements, and that the key to preserving our telomeres and stimulating telomerase activity comes from leading a healthy life.\nIn recent years Blackburn and her colleagues have been investigating the effect of stress on telomerase and telomeres with particular emphasis on  meditation. She is also one of several biologists (and one of two Nobel Prize laureates) in the 1995 science documentary . Studies suggest that chronic psychological stress may accelerate ageing at the cellular level. Intimate partner violence was found to shorten telomere length in formerly abused women versus never abused women, possibly causing poorer overall health and greater morbidity in abused women.\nAt the University of California San Francisco, Blackburn currently researches telomeres and telomerase in many organisms, from yeast to human cells. The lab is focused on telomere maintenance, and how this has an impact on cellular aging. Many chronic diseases have been associated with the improper maintenance of these telomeres, thereby effecting cellular division, cycling, and impaired growth. At the cutting edge of telomere research, the Blackburn lab currently investigates the impact of limited maintenance of telomeres in cells through altering the enzyme telomerase.\nBlackburns awards and honors include:\nBlackburn was elected:\nIn 2007, Blackburn was listed among 's \nBlackburn splits her time living between La Jolla and  with her husband, scientist John W.

He married the daughter of president . Saavedra Lamas achieved renown not only as foreign minister of Argentina for his practical work in drafting international agreements and in conducting international mediation, but also as a professor for his scholarship in the fields of labor legislation and international law.\nSaavedra Lamas was a distinguished student at Lacordaire College and at the  where he received the Doctor of Laws degree in 1903, . After study in Paris and travel abroad, he accepted a professorship in law and constitutional history at the , where he began the teaching career that was to span more than forty years. Later, he inaugurated a course in sociology at the University of Buenos Aires, taught political economy and constitutional law in the Law School of the university, and eventually served as the president of the university.\nSaavedra Lamas was a leading Argentine academician in two areas. A pioneer in the field of labor legislation, he edited several treatises on labor legislation in Argentina and on the need for a universally recognized doctrine on the treatment of labor - among them, Centro de legislac\u00edon social y del trabajo (1927) [Center of Social and Labor Legislation], Trait\u00e9s internationaux de type social (1924), C\u00f3digo nacional del trabajo (three volumes, 1933) [National Code of Labor Law]. In the arena of practical affairs, Saavedra Lamas drafted legislation affecting labor in Argentina, supported the founding of the International Labor Organization in 1919, and presided over the ILO Conference of 1928 in Geneva while serving simultaneously as leader of the Argentine delegation.\nIn international law, his other field of major scholarly interest, he published \"La Crise de la codification et de la doctrine Argentine de droit international\" (1931); and he spoke, wrote, or drafted legislation on many subjects with international ramifications - among them, asylum, colonization, immigration, arbitration, and international peace. His brief Vida internacional, which he wrote at the age of seventy, is an urbane by-product of all this study and experience.\nSaavedra Lamas began his political career in 1906 as director of Public Credit and then became the secretary-general for the municipality of Buenos Aires in 1907. In 1908 he was elected to the first of two successive terms in Parliament. There he initiated legislation regarding coastal water rights, irrigation, sugar production, government finances, colonization, and immigration. His main interest, however, lay in foreign affairs. He provided leadership in saving Argentina's arbitration treaty with Italy, which almost foundered in 1907-1908, and eventually became the unofficial adviser to both the legislature and the foreign office on the analysis and implications of proposed foreign treaties. Saavedra Lamas though was also a controversial public figure as he was seen by the masses as an elitist patrician who was too conservative and favored British intervention, especially in railroad construction.\nAppointed minister of Justice and Education in 1915, he instituted educational reforms by integrating the different divisions of public education and by developing a curriculum at the intermediate level for the vocational and technical training of manpower needed in a developing industrial country.\nWhen General  became president of Argentina in 1932, he appointed Saavedra Lamas as foreign minister. In this post for six years, Saavedra Lamas brought international prestige to Argentina. He played an important role in every South American diplomatic issue of the middle thirties, induced Argentina to rejoin the League of Nations after an absence of thirteen years, and represented Argentina at virtually every international meeting of consequence during this period.\nHis work in ending the  between Paraguay and Bolivia (1932\u20131935) had not only local significance but generalized international importance as well. When he took over the foreign office, he immediately engaged in a series of moves to lay the diplomatic groundwork for a negotiated settlement of this dispute. In 1932 he initiated at Washington the Declaration of August 3 which put the American states on record as refusing to recognize any territorial change in the hemisphere brought about by force. Next, he drew up a Treaty of Nonaggression and Conciliation which was signed by six South American countries in October, 1933, and by all of the American countries at the Seventh Pan-American Conference at Montevideo two months later. In 1935 he organized mediation by six neutral American nations which resulted in the cessation of hostilities between Paraguay and Bolivia. Meanwhile, in 1934, Saavedra Lamas presented the South American Antiwar Pact to the League of Nations where it was well received and signed by eleven countries. Acclaimed for all of these efforts, he was elected president of the Assembly of the League of Nations in 1936.\nAfter his retirement from the foreign ministry in 1938, Saavedra Lamas returned to academic life, became president of the University of Buenos Aires for two years (1941\u20131943), and rounded out his career as a professor for an additional three years (1943\u20131946).\nSaavedra Lamas was known as a strict disciplinarian in his office, a logician at the conference table, a charming host in his home or his art gallery, and a man of sartorial elegance who wore, it is said, the highest collars in Buenos Aires. In addition to the , he was awarded the  and analogous honors from ten other countries.\nHe died in 1959 at the age of eighty from the effects of a brain hemorrhage.\nIn March 2014 his solid gold Nobel medal was put up for auction after being found in a South American pawn shop.\nIn August 2014 a project for rebuying his Nobel medal by the Argentine Nation was presented at the Argentine congress. His auctioned medal was later won and is now owned by a private Asian collector.\n\n"},

Luis Leloir is buried in , .\nLeloir's parents, Federico Augusto Rufino Leloir Bernal and Hortensia Aguirre de Leloir, traveled from Buenos Aires to Paris in the middle of 1906 with the intention of treating Federico's illness. However, Federico died in late August, and a week later Luis was born in an old house at 81 V\u00edctor Hugo Road in Paris, a few blocks away from the . After returning to Argentina in 1908, Leloir lived together with his eight siblings on their family's extensive property  that his grandparents had purchased after their immigration from the  of northern : El Tuy\u00fa comprises 400\u00a0km of sandy land along the coastline from  to  which has since become a popular tourist attraction.\nDuring his childhood, the future Nobel Prize winner found himself observing natural phenomena with particular interest; his schoolwork and readings highlighted the connections between the natural sciences and biology. His education was divided between Escuela General San Mart\u00edn (primary school),  (secondary school), and for a few months at  in . His grades were unspectacular, and his first stint in college ended quickly when he abandoned his architectural studies that he had begun in Paris' .\nIt was during the 1920s that Leloir invented  (golf sauce). After being served prawns with the usual sauce during lunch with a group of friends at the Ocean Club in Mar del Plata, Leloir came up with a peculiar combination of ketchup and mayonnaise to spice up his meal. With the financial difficulties that later plagued Leloir's laboratories and research, he would joke, \"If I had patented that sauce, we'd have a lot more money for research right now.\"\nAfter returning again to , Leloir obtained his Argentine citizenship and joined the Department of Medicine at the  in hopes of receiving his doctorate. However, he got off to a rocky start, requiring four attempts to pass his anatomy exam. He finally received his diploma in 1932 and began his residency in the  and his medical internship in Ramos Mej\u00eda hospital. After some initial conflicts with colleagues and complications in his method of treating patients, Leloir decided to dedicate himself to research in the laboratory, claiming that \"we could do little for our patients... antibiotics, psychoactive d, and all the new therapeutic agents were unknown [at the time].\"\nIn 1933, he met , who pointed Leloir towards investigating in his doctoral thesis the  and carbohydrate metabolism. Houssay happened to be friends with , the brother-in-law of , one of Leloir's cousins. Following the recommendation of Udaondo, Leloir began working with Houssay, who in 1947 would later win the . The two would develop a close relationship, collaborating on various projects until Houssay's death in 1971; in his lecture after winning the Nobel Prize, Leloir claimed that his \"whole research career has been influenced by one person, Prof. Bernardo A. Houssay\".\nAfter only two years, Leloir received recognition from the medical department at UBA for having produced the best doctoral thesis. Feeling that his knowledge in fields such as , , , and  was lacking, he continued attending classes at the University as a part-time student. In 1936 he traveled to England to begin advanced studies at the , under the supervision of another Nobel Prize winner, Sir , who had obtained that distinction in 1929 for his work in  and in revealing the critical role of  in maintaining good health. Leloir's research in the Biochemical Laboratory of Cambridge centered around , more specifically the effects of  and  on succinic dehydrogenase; from this moment Leloir began to specialize in researching carbohydrate metabolism.\nLeloir returned to Buenos Aires in 1937 after his brief stay at Cambridge. 1943 saw Leloir marry; Luis Leloir and Amelia Zuberbuhler (1920-2013) would later have a daughter also named Amelia. However, his return to Argentina was amidst conflict and strife;  Houssay had been expelled from the University of Buenos Aires for signing a public petition opposing the  regime in  and the military government led  by . Leloir fled to the , where he assumed the position of associate professor in the Department of  at , collaborating with  and  and thereafter worked with  at the College of Physicians and Surgeons,  as a research assistant. Leloir would later credit Green with instilling within him the initiative to establish his own research in Argentina.\nIn 1945, Leloir ended his exile and returned to Argentina to work under Houssay at the , which Leloir would direct from its creation in 1947 by businessman and patron . Initially, the institute was composed of five rooms, a bathroom, central hall, patio, kitchen, and changing room. During the final years of the 1940s, although lacking financial resources and operating with very low-cost teams, Leloir's successful experiments would reveal the chemical origins of sugar synthesis in  as well as the  of  in the liver; together with J. M. Mu\u00f1oz, he produced an active cell-free system, a first in scientific research. It had initially been assumed that in order to study a cell, scientists could not separate it from its host organism, as oxidation could only occur in intact cells. Along the way, Mu\u00f1oz and Leloir, unable to procure the costly centrifuge needed to separate cell contents, improvised by spinning a tire stuffed with salt and ice.\nBy 1947 he had formed a team that included \nCaputto, Enrico Cabib, Ra\u00fal Trucco, Alejandro Paladini, Carlos Cardini and Jos\u00e9 Luis Reissig, with whom he investigated and discovered why a malfunctioning kidney and  helped cause . That same year,  his colleague , in his investigations of the , made discoveries regarding carbohydrate storage and its subsequent transformation into a reserve energy form in organisms.\nAt the beginning of 1948, Leloir and his team identified the sugar nucleotides that were fundamental to the metabolism of carbohydrates, turning the Instituto Campomar into a biochemistry institution well known throughout the world. Immediately thereafter, Leloir received the Argentine Scientific Society Prize,  one of the many awards he would receive both in Argentina and internationally. During this time, his team dedicated itself to the study of ; Leloir and his colleagues elucidated the primary mechanisms of galactose metabolism (now coined the ) and determined the cause of galactosemia, a serious  that resulted in .\nThe following year, he reached an agreement with Rolando Garc\u00eda, dean of the  at UBA, which named Leloir, Carlos Eugenio Cardini and Enrico Cabib as titular professors in the University's newly founded Biochemical Institute. The Institute would help develop scientific programs in budding Argentine universities as well as attract researchers and scholars from the United States, , England, France, Spain, and other Latin American countries.\nFollowing Campomar's death in 1957, Leloir and his team applied to the  in the United States desperate for funding, and surprisingly was accepted. In 1958, the Institute found a new home in a former all-girls school, a donation from the Argentine government. As Leloir and his research gained greater prominence, further research came from the Argentine Research Council, and the Institute would later become associated with the University of Buenos Aires.\nAs his work in the laboratory was coming to an end, Leloir continued his teaching position in the Department of Natural Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires, taking a hiatus only to complete his studies at Cambridge and at the Enzyme Research Laboratory in the United States.\nIn 1983, Leloir became one of the founding members of the Third World Academy of Sciences, later renamed the .\nOn December 2, 1970, Leloir received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry from the King of  for his discovery of the  in , becoming only the third Argentine to receive the prestigious honor in any field. In his acceptance speech at , he borrowed from 's famous 1940 speech to the  and remarked, \"never have I received so much for so little\". Leloir and his team reportedly celebrated by drinking champagne from test tubes, a rare departure from the humility and frugality that characterized the atmosphere of Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Campomar under Leloir's direction. The $80,000 prize money was spent directly on research, and when asked about the significance of his achievement, Leloir responded:\nLeloir published a short autobiography, entitled \"Long Ago and Far Away\" in the 1983 . The title, Leloir claims, is derived from one of 's novels that depicted the country wildlife and scenery of Leloir's childhood.\nHe died in Buenos Aires December 2, 1987, of a heart attack soon after returning to his home from the laboratory, and is buried in . , a friend and colleague of Leloir, claims that his lasting legacy was proving that \"scientific research on an international level, although precarious, was possible in an underdeveloped country in the middle of political strife\" and credits Leloir's vigilance and will for his ultimate success. With his research in dire financial straits, Leloir often resorted to homemade gadgets and contraptions to continue his work in the laboratory. In one instance, Leloir reportedly used waterproof cardboard to create makeshift gutters in order to protect his laboratory's library from the rain.\nLeloir was known for his humility, focus and consistency, described by many as a \"true monk in science\". Every morning his wife Amelia would drive him in their  and drop him off at 1719 Juli\u00e1n Alvarez Street, location of Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Campomar, with Leloir wearing the same worn out, gray overalls.

Thereafter, he was a member of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, England, and held dual Argentine and British citizenship. In 1956, he received an award from the Sociedad Bioqu\u00edmica Argentina for his work on  with the  aldehyde dehydrogenase. In 1958, funded by the , he joined the  Department at the  at  to work for a PhD under  on the mechanism of metal activation of the enzyme . During this work, he collaborated with  whose group he joined with a short-term  appointment.\nThe major part of Milstein's research career was devoted to studying the structure of antibodies and the mechanism by which antibody diversity is generated. It was as part of this quest that, in 1975, he worked with  (a postdoctoral fellow in his laboratory) to develop the  technique for the production of \u2014a discovery recognized by the award of the 1984 . This discovery led to an enormous expansion in the exploitation of antibodies in science and medicine.\nMilstein himself made many major contributions to improvements and developments in monoclonal antibody technology\u2014especially in the use of  to provide markers that allow distinction between different cell types. In collaboration with Claudio Cuello, Milstein helped lay the foundation for the use of monoclonal antibodies as probes for the investigation of the pathological pathways in neurological disorders as well as many other diseases. Milstein and Cuello's work also enabled the use of monoclonal antibodies to enhance the power of immuno-based diagnostic tests. In addition, Milstein foresaw the potential wealth of ligand-binding reagents that could result from applying recombinant  technology to monoclonal antibodies and inspired the development of the field of antibody engineering which was to lead to safer and more powerful monoclonal antibodies for use as therapeutics.\nMilstein's early work on antibodies focused on their diversity at the amino acid level, as well as on the disulfide bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies, where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted  that contained a signal sequence. The development of the  technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of  of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody . In this process, localized mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved , which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in recent years was devoted to characterizing this mutational process, with a view to understanding its mechanism. He contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.\nQuite apart from his own achievements, Milstein acted as a guide and inspiration to many in the antibody field, as well as devoting himself to assisting science and scientists in less developed countries. It is also worth mentioning, that even though the Nobel Prize would have made him a wealthy man, Milstein did not patent his enormous discovery since he believed that it was mankind's intellectual property. According to his beliefs, his work did not have any economic interest, only scientific.\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize 1984, Milstein was elected a , was a fellow of  from 1980 to 2002, awarded the  from  in 1980, won the  in 1989, and became a  in 1995. In 1993, the Argentinian  granted him the Diamond , one of the most prestigious cultural awards of Argentina, as the most important scientist in the last decade of his country.\nMilstein married Celia Prilleltensky in 1953.\nMilstein died early on 24 March 2002 in , England at age 74, as a result of a heart condition that he had suffered from for many years.\nThe film \"Un fueguito, la historia de C\u00e9sar Milstein\" was released in 2010.

He was joint recipient (with his father, ) of the  in 1915, \"For their services in the analysis of  by means of \"; an important step in the development of X-ray crystallography.\nBragg was  in 1941. As of 2020, he is the youngest ever  in physics, having received the award at the age of 25 years (youngest ever Nobel winner in any field is , who received Nobel Peace prize in 2014 at the age of 17). Bragg was the director of the , Cambridge, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was reported by  and  in February 1953.\nBragg was born in , South Australia to  (1862\u20131942),  Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the , and Gwendoline (1869\u20131929), daughter of , government astronomer of South Australia.\nHe showed an early interest in science and mathematics. Shortly after starting school he fell from his tricycle and broke his arm. His father, who had read about 's experiments in Europe and was performing his own experiments, used the newly discovered X-rays and his experimental equipment to examine the broken arm. This is the first recorded surgical use of X-rays in Australia.\nIn 1900, Bragg was a student at , followed by five years at . He went to the University of Adelaide at the age of 16 to study mathematics, chemistry and physics, graduating in 1908. In the same year his father accepted the Cavendish chair of physics at the , and brought the family to England. Bragg entered  in the autumn of 1909 and received a major scholarship in mathematics, despite taking the exam while in bed with . After initially excelling in mathematics, he transferred to the physics course in the later years of his studies, and graduated with first class honours in 1911. In 1914 Bragg was elected to a Fellowship at Trinity College \u2013 a Fellowship at a Cambridge college involves the submission and defence of a thesis.\nAmong Bragg's other interests was ; his personal collection amounted to specimens from some 500 species; all personally collected from South Australia. He discovered a new species of  \u2013 , named for him by .\nThe composition of X-rays was unknown, his father argued that X-rays are streams of particles, others argued that they are waves.  directed an X-ray beam at a crystal in front of a photographic plate; alongside of the spot where the beam struck there were additional spots from deflected rays \u2013 hence X-rays are waves. In 1912, as a first-year research student at Cambridge, W. L. Bragg, while strolling by the river, had the insight that crystals made from parallel sheets of atoms would not diffract X-ray beams that struck their surface at most angles because X-rays deflected by collisions with atoms would be out of phase, cancelling one another out. However, when the X-ray beam stuck at an angle at which the distances it passed between atomic sheets in the crystal equalled the X-ray's wavelength then those deflected would be in phase and produce a spot on a nearby film. From this insight he wrote the simple  that relates the wavelength of the X-ray and the distance between atomic sheets in a simple crystal to the angles at which an impinging X-ray beam would be reflected.\nHis father built an  in which a crystal could be rotated to precise angles while measuring the energy of reflections. This enabled father and son to measure the distances between the atomic sheets in a number of simple crystals. They calculated the spacing of the atoms from the weight of the crystal and the , which enabled them to measure the wavelengths of the X-rays produced by different metallic targets in the X-ray tubes. W. H. Bragg reported their results at meetings and in a paper, giving credit to \"his son\" (unnamed) for the equation, but not as a co-author, which gave his son \"some heartaches\", .\nBragg was commissioned early in  in the  as a  of the . In 1915 he was seconded to the  to develop a method to localise enemy artillery from the boom of their firing. On 2 September 1915 his brother was killed during the . Shortly afterwards, he and his father were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. He was 25 years old and remains the youngest science laureate. The problem with  was that the heavy guns boomed at too low a frequency to be detected by a microphone. After months of frustrating failure he and his group devised a hot wire air wave detector that solved the problem. In this work he was aided by , ,  and Henry Harold Hemming. British sound ranging was very effective; there was a unit in every British Army and their system was adopted by the Americans when they entered the war. For his work during the war he was awarded the  and appointed . He was also  on 16 June 1916, 4 January 1917 and 7 July 1919.\nHot wire sound ranging was used in  during which he served as a civilian adviser.\nBetween the wars, from 1919 to 1937, he worked at the  as  of Physics. He became the director of the  in Teddington in 1937.\nAfter World War II, Bragg returned to Cambridge, splitting the  into research groups. He believed that \"the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants\".\nWhen demobilised he returned to crystallography at Cambridge. They had agreed that father would study organic crystals, son would investigate inorganic compounds. In 1919 when , a long-time family friend, moved to Cambridge, Lawrence Bragg replaced him as Langworthy Professor of Physics at the . He recruited an excellent faculty, including former sound rangers, but he believed that his knowledge of physics was weak and he had no classroom experience. The students, many veterans, were critical and rowdy. He was deeply shaken but with family support he pulled himself together and prevailed. He and R. W. James measured the absolute energy of reflected X-rays, which validated a formula derived by C. G. Darwin before the war. Now they could determine the number of electrons in the reflecting targets, and they were able to decipher the structures of more complicated crystals like silicates. It was still difficult: requiring repeated guessing and retrying. In the late 1920s they eased the analysis by using  on the data.\nIn 1930 he became deeply disturbed while weighing a job offer from Imperial College, London. His family rallied around and he recovered his balance while they spent 1931 in Munich, where he did research.\nHe became director of the  in Teddington in 1937, bringing some co-workers along. However, administration and committees took much of his time away from the workbench.\nRutherford died and the search committee named Lawrence Bragg as next in the line of the  who direct the . The Laboratory had an eminent history in atomic physics and some members were wary of a crystallographer, which Bragg surmounted by even-handed administration. He worked on improving the interpretation of diffraction patterns. In the small crystallography group was a refugee research student without a mentor: . He showed Bragg X-ray diffraction data from , which suggested that the structure of giant biological molecules might be deciphered. Bragg appointed Perutz as his research assistant and within a few months obtained additional support with a grant from the . The work was suspended during the Second World War when Perutz was interned as an enemy alien and then worked in military research.\nDuring the war the Cavendish offered a shortened graduate course which emphasised the electronics needed for . Bragg worked on the structure of metals and consulted on sonar and sound ranging, they still used the Tucker microphone. He became Sir Lawrence in 1941. His father died in 1942, during which Bragg served for six months as Scientific Liaison Officer to Canada. He organised periodic conferences on X-ray analysis, which was widely used in military research.\nAfter the war he led in the formation of the  and was elected its first president. He reorganised the Cavendish into units to reflect his conviction that \"the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants, helped by one or more first-class instrument mechanics and a workshop in which the general run of apparatus can be constructed.\" Senior members of staff now had offices, telephones and secretarial support. The scope of the department was enlarged with a new unit on radio astronomy. His own work focused on the structure of metals, using both X-rays and the . In 1947 he persuaded the  (MRC) to support what he described as the \"gallant attempt\" to determine protein structure as the , initially consisting of Perutz,  and two assistants. Bragg worked with them, by 1960 they had resolved the structure of  to the atomic level. After this he was less involved; their analysis of  was easier after they incorporated two mercury atoms as markers in each molecule. The first monumental triumph of the MRC was decoding the structure of DNA by  and . Bragg announced the discovery at a  on proteins in Belgium on 8 April 1953, it went unreported by the press. He then gave a talk at  in London on Thursday 14 May 1953, which resulted in an article by  in the  of London on Friday 15 May 1953, entitled \"Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life\". Bragg nominated Crick, Watson and  for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; Wilkins' share recognised the contribution of X-ray crystallographers at . Among them was , whose \"\" showed that DNA was a double , not the triple helix that  had proposed. Franklin died before the prize (which only goes to living people) was awarded.\nIn 1953 the Braggs moved into the elegant flat for the Resident Professor in the  in London, the position his father had occupied when he died. In 1934 and 1961 Lawrence had delivered the  and since 1938 he had been Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Institution, delivering an annual lecture. His father's successors had weakened the Institution, so Bragg had to rebuild it. He bolstered finances by enlisting corporate sponsors, the traditional Friday Evening Discourses were followed by a dinner party for the speaker and carefully selected possible patrons, more than 120 of them each year. \"Two of these Discourses in 1965 gave him particular pleasure. On 7 May, Lady Bragg, who had been a member of the Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce (1951\u201355) and was Chairman of the , lectured on 'Changing patterns in marriage and divorce'; and on 15 November, Bragg listened with evident pride to the Discourse on 'Oscillations and noise in jet engines' given by his engineer-son , who was then Chief Scientist at Rolls Royce Ltd and later became Vice-Chancellor of .\" He also introduced a programme of highly regarded Schools' Lectures, enlivened by the elaborate demonstrations that were a hallmark of the Institution. He gave three of these lectures on \"electricity\".\nHe continued research in the Institution by recruiting a small group to work the Davy-Faraday Laboratory in the basement and in the adjoining house, supported by grants he obtained. A visitor to the laboratory succeeded in inserting heavy metals into the enzyme ; the structure of its crystal was solved in 1965 at the Royal Institution by  and his coworkers, with the computations on the 9,040 reflections performed on the digital computer at the University of London, which greatly facilitated the work. Two of the illustrations of the positioning of amino acids in the chain were drawn by Bragg. Unlike myoglobin, in which nearly 80 per cent of the amino-acid residues are in the  conformation, in lysozyme the alpha-helix content is only about 40 per cent of the amino-acid residues found in four main stretches. Other stretches are of the , a conformation that they had proposed earlier. In this conformation, every third peptide is hydrogen-bonded back to the first peptide, thus forming a ring containing ten atoms. They had the complete structure of an enzyme in time for Bragg's 75th birthday. He became Professor Emeritus in 1966.\nX-ray analysis of protein structure flourished in subsequent years, determining the structures of scores of proteins in laboratories around the world. Twenty eight Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work using X-ray analysis. The disadvantage of the method is that it must be done on crystals, which precludes seeing changes in shape when enzymes bind substrates and the like. This problem was solved by the development of another line Bragg had initiated, using modified electron microscopes to image single frozen molecules: .\nIn his long association with the  he was:\nIn 1921 he married Alice Hopkinson (1899\u20131989), a cousin of a friend who had been killed in the war.

Alice was on the staff at  until Bragg was appointed director of the National Physical Laboratory in 1937. She was active in a number of public bodies and served as  from 1945-46.\nBragg's hobbies included drawing \u2013 family letters were illustrated with lively sketches \u2013 painting, literature and a lifelong interest in gardening. When he moved to London, he missed having a garden and so worked as a part-time gardener, unrecognised by his employer, until a guest at the house expressed surprise at seeing him there. He died at a hospital near his home at , , Suffolk. He was buried in ; his son David is buried in the  in Cambridge, where Bragg's friend, who had he survived would have been his brother-in-law, Rudolph Cecil Hopkinson is also buried.\nIn August 2013, Bragg's relative, the broadcaster , presented a BBC Radio 4 programme (\"Bragg on the Braggs\") on the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics winners.\nBragg was elected a  \u2013 \"a qualification that makes other ones irrelevant\".

However, the researchers did not have enough penicillin to help him to a full recovery, and he relapsed and died. Because of this experience and the difficulty in producing penicillin, the researchers changed their focus to children, who could be treated with smaller quantities of penicillin.\nFlorey's research team investigated the large-scale production of the mould and efficient extraction of the active ingredient, succeeding to the point where, by 1945, penicillin production was an industrial process for the Allies in World War II.

For his contributions to Australian science, he was made the first  in 1960, and in 1978 a Knight of the . He was recognised internationally for his achievements: in addition to the Nobel, he received the  and the  and  from the , honorary doctorates, and distinguished service honours from the  and Japan.\nBurnet was born in , ; his father, Frank Burnet, a Scottish emigrant to Australia, was the manager of the Traralgon branch of the Colonial Bank. His mother Hadassah Burnet (n\u00e9e Mackay) was the daughter of a middle-class Scottish immigrant, and met his father when Frank was working in the town of . Frank was 36, and 14 years older than Hadassah. The family was socially conservative Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Frank Macfarlane Burnet was the second of seven children and from childhood was known as \"Mac\". He had an older sister, two younger sisters and three younger brothers. The eldest daughter Doris had a mental disability that consumed most of Hadassah's time and the family saw Doris's condition as an unspoken stigma, discouraging the other children from inviting friends home, lest they come across the eldest daughter. From his early years in Traralgon, Mac enjoyed exploring the environment around him, particularly Traralgon Creek. He first attended a private school run by a single teacher before starting at the government primary school at the age of 7. Mac was distant from his father\u2014who liked to spend his free time fishing and playing golf\u2014from a young age. He preferred bookish pursuits from a young age and was not enamoured of sport, and by the age of eight was old enough to analyse his father's character; Mac disapproved of Frank and saw him as a hypocrite who espoused moral principles and put on a facade of uprightedness, while associating with businessmen of dubious ethics. Hadassah was preoccupied with Doris, so Mac developed a rather solitary personality.\nThe Burnets moved to  in 1909, when Frank was posted to be the bank manager there, having declined a post in London. Burnet was interested in the wildlife around the nearby ; he joined the  in 1910 and enjoyed all outdoor activities. While living in Terang, he began to collect  and study biology. He read biology articles in the , which introduced him to the work of . During his early teens, the family took annual holidays to , where Burnet spent his time observing and recording the behaviour of the wildlife. He was educated at Terang State School and attended Sunday school at the local church, where the priest encouraged him to pursue scholastic studies and awarded him a book on ants as a reward for his academic performance. He advised Frank to invest in Mac's education and he won a full scholarship to board and study at , one of Victoria's most exclusive private schools. Starting there in 1913, Burnet was the only boarder with a full scholarship. He did not enjoy his time there among the scions of the ruling upper class; while most of his peers were brash and sports-oriented, Burnet was bookish and not athletically inclined, and found his fellow students to be arrogant and boorish. During this period he kept his beetle-collecting and disapproval of his peers a secret and mixed with his schoolmates out of necessity. Nevertheless, his academic prowess gained him privileges, and he graduated in 1916, placing first in his school overall, and in history, English, chemistry and physics. The typical university path for a person of his social background was to pursue studies in theology, law or medicine. By this time, he was becoming disillusioned with religion and chose medicine. Due to World War I, military service was a possibility and he felt that a medical background would increase his chances of being given a non-combat post.\nFrom 1918, Burnet attended the , where he lived in  on a residential scholarship. There, he read more of Darwin's work and was influenced by the ideas of science and society in the writings of . He enjoyed his time at university and spent much of his free time reading biology books in the library to feed his passion for scientific knowledge. He also had fleeting sporting success, holding down a position in Ormond's First VIII rowing squad for a brief period. He continued to pursue his study of beetles in private, although his classmates found out and there was no loss in this as they viewed his hobby positively. Despite an ongoing shyness, Burnet got on well with staff and students at university. Burnet was self-motivated and often skipped lectures to study at his own faster pace and pursue further knowledge in the library, and he came equal first in physics and chemistry in first year. The following year, 1918, he became increasingly immersed in laboratory work, but he was also dogged by peer pressure to enlist in the , which he saw as a distasteful prospect. However, this was averted by the end of the . In 1919, he was one of 12 high-performing students selected for extra tuition, and he came equal first in third year physiology. He began clinical work in the same year, but found it somewhat unpleasant as he was interested in diagnosing the patient and had little interest in showing empathy towards them.\nWhile at university, he became an  and later an aggressive atheist; he was sceptical of religious faith, which he regarded as \"an effort to believe what common sense tells you isn't true.\" He was also disgusted by what he regarded as hypocritical conduct by religious adherents. Towards the later years of his undergraduate years, his unhappiness with religion began to dog him to a greater extent. He tried to become involved with  for a brief period but then resolved to devote himself to scientific research. The length of time required to study medicine had been reduced to five years to train doctors faster following the outbreak of , and Burnet graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and a Bachelor of Surgery in 1922, ranking second in the final exams despite the death of his father a few weeks earlier. His fellow graduates included , , , Rupert Willis and , who became distinguished scientists in their own right.\nHe then did a ten-month residency at  to gain experience before going into practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under  and , both well known surgeons. He enjoyed this period immensely and was disappointed when he had to do his medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist , whom Burnet came to idolise. As a result of this he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the  was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, who was in charge of such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more suited to a laboratory research career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. Burnet complied.\nDuring the transition period he worked as a pathology registrar at the  and also prepared for his Doctor of Medicine examinations, late in 1923. In 1923 he took up the post of senior resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital; the laboratories were a part of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He conducted research into the  reactions in , leading to his first scientific publications. He decided to work full-time on the  response in , even though he was technically supposed to pursuing  as part of his obligations to the hospital. Burnet came first in the Doctor of Medicine exams by a long distance, and his score was excluded from the scaling process so that the other students would not fail for being so far behind.\nAt the time, the Hall Institute was in the early stages of rapid expansion. The new director of the Institute, , wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in ,  and  that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to Burnet and saw him as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on  in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the  at the  in . Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was free to do his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if  was affected by .\nHe was awarded the  by the Lister Institute in 1926; this gave him enough money for him to resign his curator position and he began full-time research on bacteriophages. He injected mice with bacteriophage and observed their immunological reactions and believed bacteriophages to be . For this work he received a Ph.D. from the  in 1928 under the direction of Professor  and was invited to write a chapter on bacteriophages for the  . He was also given an invitation to deliver a paper at the  in 1927 on the link between O-agglutinins and bacteriophage. Burnet began attending the  functions and befriended some communists, although he refrained from joining them in overt left-wing activism. He also spent his free time enjoying theatre, engaging in amateur  and cycling through continental Europe.\nWhile in London, Burnet became engaged to fellow Australian Edith Linda Marston Druce. She was a secondary school teacher and daughter of a barrister's clerk and the pair had met in 1923 and had a few dates but did not keep in touch. Druce sought out Burnet while on a holiday in London and they quickly agreed to marriage although she had to return to Australia. They married in 1928 after he had completed his Ph.D. and returned to Australia, and had a son and two daughters. At the time, there was a vacancy for the Chair of Bacteriology at the University of London, and Ledingham was lobbying his colleagues to offer Burnet the post, but Burnet returned to Australia, partly because of Druce.\nWhen Burnet returned to Australia, he went back to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, where he was appointed assistant director by Kellaway. His first assignment was to investigate the \"Bundaberg disaster\", in which 12 children had died after receiving a contaminated  vaccine. Kellaway was put in charge of a  to investigate the matter and he put Burnet in charge of the laboratory investigations. He identified  in the toxin- mixture that had been administered to the children; it had been picked up from the skin of one of the children and then transmitted to the others in the injections. However, it turned out to be another toxin that had caused the children's deaths; this work on staphylococcal toxin piqued his interest in immunology. During this time, he continued to study bacteriophages, writing 32 papers on phages between 1924 and 1937. In 1929, Burnet and his graduate assistant Margot McKie wrote a paper suggesting that bacteriophages could exist as a stable non-infectious form that multiplies with the bacterial host. Their pioneering description of  was not accepted until much later, and was crucial to the work of ,  and  on the replication mechanism and genetics of viruses, for which they were awarded the 1969 .\nBetween 1932 and 1933, Burnet took leave of absence to undertake a fellowship at the  in London. The Great Depression had resulted in Burnet's salary being cut from 1000 to 750 pounds, and the National Institute had been given a large grant from the  that allowed them to hire Burnet at 1000 pounds per annum. The National Institute's Director Sir  gained permission from Kellaway for the two-year move; Kellaway promised to hold Burnet's job for him when he returned and felt that the experience would make Burnet\u2014whom he saw as the Hall Institute's brightest young scientist\u2014better equipped to expand operations when he returned to Melbourne. Dale also paid for Burnet's sister to travel to England to help look after her brother's young children.\nSignificant breakthroughs in virology were made while he was there, including the isolation and first demonstration of the transmission of the  virus. His own research was on the , which he used in developing a chick embryo assay for the isolation and quantification of animal viruses. Dale offered Burnet a permanent position but he declined and returned to the Hall Institute. Following his productive work in London, the Rockefeller Institute agreed to fund a new virus research laboratory in Melbourne for Burnet. He brought back a set of viruses from the National Institute to begin the basis of research in Melbourne.\nWhen Burnet returned to Australia, he continued his work on virology, including the  of . He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of  and . After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban in order to prevent human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist , the causative organism of which was named  in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of herpes and Q fever displayed an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his scientific method.\nDuring World War II, Burnet's research moved to  and . With the outbreak of war, Burnet was handed more responsibility and made acting director and had to oversee the move into a new building as Kellaway was seconded to the military in 1939. Due to Kellaway, many of the infectious disease problems afflicting the military were referred to the Institute. Fearing a repeat of the massive global influenza outbreak that occurred after World War I, Burnet focused the Institute in the search for a vaccine. He first tested the vaccine on a group of medical students, and after a promising test on 107 army volunteers in February 1942 following a rise in infections, a large-scale program was introduced two months later to inoculate all new recruits after an influenza A outbreak. In this trial, 20,000 personnel were vaccinated, without success, and the scheme was abandoned. In 1942, the investigations into scrub typhus accelerated after an exodus of researchers in that field from  after the  conquest of the area. However, this ended in tragedy when his collaborator  accidentally injected herself and then died of the infection. Nevertheless, his work on immunisation had earned him international recognition by this time.\nBurnet's first book, , was published in 1940. It had wide influence and was translated into several languages. In 1942 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1944 he travelled to  to deliver the Dunham Lectures. There he was offered a chair, but he refused and returned to Australia. This was attributed to his nationalistic tendencies, as well as his sense of loyalty to the Hall Institute. During his trip he also visited the US military facility at , where he discussed his work on influenza with the scientists working there.\nIn 1944, he was appointed director of the Institute when Kellaway was appointed director of the . Although Kellaway had groomed Burnet to become a pivotal figure, he was hesitant as to whether Burnet would be at his most effective with a strategic leadership role. Kellaway thought that Burnet might not be suited to the post, and should have continued to focus purely on research for the time being. Burnet had similar doubts, particularly given his taciturn nature, but applied for the position anyway. Although he was not known for his social skills, his ability as a scientist and to impart ideas for investigation to his subordinates held his leadership and the Institute in good stead. Unlike his predecessor, who valued a broad gamut of research activities, Burnet was of the opinion that the Institute could not make a significant impact at global level in this way, and he pursued a policy of focusing all effort into one area at a time. Always a strong-willed and rather isolated man, he became more single-minded and less tolerant of criticism of his work and expected a more hierarchical structure and unquestioning obedience. According to biographer Sexton, he \"displayed a kind of territorial protectiveness in relation to his own work\".\nIn 1944, it was decided by the University of Melbourne that Burnet would be appointed a professor as part of a cooperative program so that university students could be experimentally trained at the Institute, while the researchers engaged in some teaching. This was not a success, and there was much tension, as Burnet repeatedly expressed his opinion in public that university teaching and research should be kept separate, at one point leading to a series of open letters from university professors decrying his attitude. Burnet was also not interested in the politics of university funding, and his disengagement from administrative matters engendered resentment. On the other hand, Burnet was vigorous in obtaining funding for the Hall Institute from government bodies, resorting to the bluff of feigning interest in moving overseas to secure continued strong backing. However, he was criticised for being thrifty and refusing to invest in cutting edge equipment, despite the Hall Institute's high standing in research circles. Colleagues believed that he was sceptical of modern technology and thought his outlook to be limiting.\nIn 1946, he initiated the Clinical Research Unit to allow for closer cooperation with the clinical activities of the now named . Despite his known derisive views of clinical science as being inferior, he supported the work enthusiastically.\nUnder Burnet's direction, scientists at the Institute made significant contributions to infectious disease research during a period that has been called the \"golden age of virology\". Virologists including , , , , and  made significant contributions on , , , , herpes and influenza.\nBurnet made significant contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including  assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the  that is secreted by , which later provided the foundation for  significant work on  and the neuraminidase substrate, . Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.\nIn 1957, Burnet decided that research at the Institute should focus on immunology. Burnet reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned and feeling the action was arrogant; for Burnet's part he was comfortable with the decision as he thought it to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the 's . After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on immunological problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to  and the  reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of immunology, immunological surveillance and cancer.\nAt the time, immunology was becoming more sophisticated, with the increasing role of  and . Burnet was suspicious of the direction in which immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude was a factor in his decision to turn the Institute's focus to immunology.\nBurnet began to switch his focus to immunology in the 1940s. In 1941 he wrote a  called \"The Production of Antibodies\", which was revised and reissued in 1949 with Frank Fenner as a co-author. This book is seen as a key publication in immunology\u2014it marks the move from the study of immunology as a chemical endeavour to a biological one. Importantly in this work, he introduced the concept of \"self\" and \"non-self\" to immunology. The distinction between self and non-self was an integral part of Burnet's biological outlook, of his interest in the living organism in its totality, its activities, and interactions. Burnet regarded the \"self\" of the host body as being actively defined during its embryogenesis through complex interactions between immune cells and all the other cells and molecules within an embryo.\nUsing the concept of self, Burnet introduced a hypothesis about the situation where the body failed to make antibodies to its own components () and by extension the idea of . He proposed that\nBurnet was, however, unable to prove this experimentally. ,  and  did find support for Burnet's hypothesis in 1953 when they showed that  could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not from any other mouse strain. Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet and Medawar were able to coordinate their work effectively despite their rather different personalities and physical separation; Burnet was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.\nHowever, later studies showed that cells or tissues transplanted before the immune system development of the recipient, such as in embryonic recipients, could be treated as foreign and trigger rejection, countering Burnet's explanation for self tolerance. In contrast to the Burnet hypothesis of a special tolerance-inducing period defined by the age of the animal,  proposed in 1959, that it is the age of the lymphocyte that defines whether an antigen that is encountered will induce tolerance, with immature lymphocytes being tolerance-sensitive. Lederberg's concept is now known as central tolerance, and is widely accepted. It may also explain the success of some transplants given early in life and the failure to induce tolerance in other studies. Burnet noted that his contributions to immune tolerance were strictly theoretical:\nBurnet was interested in how the body produces antibodies in response to antigens. The dominant idea in the literature through the 1940s was that the antigen acted as a template for antibody production, which was known as the \"instructive\" hypothesis. Burnet was not satisfied with this explanation, and in the second edition of \"The Production of Antibodies\", he and Fenner advanced an indirect template theory which proposed that each antigen could influence the genome, thus effecting the production of antibodies. In 1956 he became interested in 's natural selection hypothesis, which described a mechanism for immune response based on an earlier theory of Nobel-winning immunologist . Jerne proposed that the antigen bound to an antibody by chance and, that upon binding, more antibodies to that antigen would be produced. Burnet developed a model which he named  that expanded on and improved Jerne's hypothesis. Burnet proposed that each  bears on its surface specific immunoglobulins reflecting the specificity of the antibody that will later be synthesised once the cell is activated by an antigen. The antigen serves as a selective stimulus, causing preferential proliferation and differentiation of\nthe clones that have receptors for that antigen.\nIn 1958  and Lederberg showed that one  always produces only one antibody, which was the first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book . His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and  as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.\nThere is some contention over Burnet's publication of his version of the theory in the  in 1957. Some commentators argue he published in an Australian journal to fast-track his hypothesis and obtain priority for his theory over ideas that were published later that year in a paper written by , which Burnet had read prior to its publication. In his paper Burnet cited Talmage's review, and in a later interview, Talmage said he believed that Burnet \"truthfully had developed the idea before he received my paper\". The theory is now sometimes known as Burnet's clonal selection theory, which overlooks the contributions of Ehrlich, Jerne, Talmage, and the contributions of Lederberg, who conceptualised the genetics of clonal selection.\nBurnet's work on graft-versus-host was in collaboration with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this was known as the Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain  in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune . They looked at the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug  to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human autoimmune disease.\nIn 1960, Burnet scaled back his laboratory work, taking one day off per week to concentrate on writing. In 1963, , which he authored with , was published. He also oversaw an expansion of the Hall Institute and secured funding from the  and the state government to build two further floors in the building and take over some of the space taken up by the pathology department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Despite this, Burnet believed that a world class research body needed to be small enough that one person could effectively run it, and maintained tight control over its activities throughout his leadership. He determined the policies himself, and personally selected all of the research staff and students, relying on a small staff to enforce his plans.\nHe continued to be active in the laboratory until his retirement in 1965, although his experimental time began to decrease as the operations became increasingly focused on immunology; Burnet's work in this area had been mostly theoretical. Gustav Nossal became the next director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. Under Burnet's leadership the Institute had become \"probably the world's best known research centre devoted to the study of immunology.\" However, with the increasing sophistication in medical science and its reliance on more complicated technology, Burnet's lone-wolf approach became less compatible with the research environment, which required more collaboration. In his final years at the helm, Burnet allowed more technical modernisation during the transition period to Nossal's leadership.\nFrom 1937 Burnet was involved in a variety of scientific and public policy bodies, starting with a position on a government advisory council on polio. After he became the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1944, he was considered a public figure and overcame shyness to become a good public speaker. He recognised the importance of co-operation with the media if the general public was to understand science and scientists, and his writings and lectures played an important part in the formulation of public attitudes and policy in Australia on a variety of biological topics. However, despite making many appearances on radio and television, he never became at ease with interviews and had to be selective with outreach engagements due to the many invitations he received, and tended to accept those that had the potential to promote the Institute. Over time, he began to increase his activism, as he felt more confident that he would be able to make an impact as his reputation grew, especially after winning the Nobel Prize, and even more so after his retirement from the directorship of the Institute. Although Burnet was not naturally outgoing, he saw it as the social responsibility of a scientific leader and scholar to publicly speak out and impart wisdom and foresight to the wider community.\nBurnet served as a member or chairman of scientific committees, both in Australia and overseas. Between 1947 and 1953, he was a member of the 's Medical Research Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for medical research in Australia. During this same period (1947\u201352), he was also a member of the  Defence Research and Development Policy Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that Burnet made the recommendation that Australia pursue development of  and  to target neighbouring countries' food stocks and spread infectious diseases. His report was titled . Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; he was concerned that Australians were being exposed to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.\nInternationally, Burnet was a chairman of the Papua New Guinea Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1962 and 1969. At the time, Papua New Guinea was an Australian territory, and Burnet had first travelled there as his son was posted there. His role on the committee allowed him to explore his interest in . He was particularly interested in  (laughing sickness), and lobbied the Australian government to establish the Papua New Guinea Institute of Human Biology. Burnet later helped oversee the institute's contribution to the Anglo-Australian participation in the International Biological Programme in the Field of Human Adaptability.\nBurnet served as first chair for the  (1966\u201369), a Commonwealth initiative to foster interaction between the member countries' elite, and he was also active in the , serving on the Expert Advisory Panels on Virus Diseases and on Immunology between 1952 and 1969 and the World Health Organization Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1969 and 1973.\nIn 1964, he was appointed to sit on the University Council of Victoria's third university  on an interim basis until the institution was formed in 1966. He served until 1970. He advocated a less hierarchical relationship between a professor and student, something seen as a move away from the English tradition prevalent in Australia towards an American model. He also called for the downgrading of the importance placed on the liberal arts. His ideas were too radical for his peers and he stepped down from the role in 1970 after none of his suggestions had made an impact.\nBurnet was opposed to the use of nuclear power in Australia owing to the issues of . He later retracted his objections to , feeling that nuclear power was necessary while other renewable energy sources were being developed. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he was also vocal in the anti-smoking movement; he was one of the first high-profile figures in Australia to educate the public on the dangers of tobacco, and he appeared in a television advertisement criticising the ethics of , and broadcasters for displaying such material. He and fellow activists were surprised that the commercial was allowed to run briefly, before being taken off air by the station, which only further generated attention for the anti-smoking campaign. A former smoker, he had rejected the habit in the 1950s after several friends died. Burnet was also a critic of the  and called for the creation of an international police force.\nFollowing his resignation from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an office at the  in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books on a variety of topics including immunology, ageing and cancer, and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled , which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He was known for his ability to write quickly, often without a final draft, and his ability to convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had much influence. In 1969 he published , considered his magnum opus on immunity, which attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the clonal selection theory. The following year, he wrote , which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused work schedule, often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.\nHe became president of the  in 1965, having been a foundational fellow when the Academy was formed in 1954. He had been offered the presidency in 1958 to replace the inaugural head Sir , but declined, although he served on the council and as vice president in 1961\u201363. As president he was recognised by both government and the public as the leading scientist in Australia. His stature as a scientist gave him the gravitas to end policy disputes, and gave the Academy and its advocacy more credibility in the eyes of government and industry. As such his term was considered to be highly successful. Oliphant said that Burnet's personal prestige was very important in the increased respect the AAS won and that he \"made the biological sciences far more acceptable in Australia\".\nHe helped establish the Academy's Science and Industry Forum, which was formed in the second year of his leadership in order to improve dialogue between researchers and industrialists. It investigated whether a national science policy should be formulated and led to the eventual creation of the . He also laid the foundations of the . When his presidency ended in 1969, the Academy founded the , which is the Academy's highest award for biological sciences.\nAs in many of his previous pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group of the scientific community and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful due to a lack of concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members\u2014such as Burnet\u2014being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.\nIn 1966, Burnet accepted a nomination from Australia Prime Minister Sir  to become the inaugural chairman of the , a body that aimed to increase the professional interchange between the various nations of the . Burnet served in the role for three years and helped start it on a path of steady growth, although he was unable to use it as a personal platform to  espouse the importance of human biology.\nBurnet's essays and books published in his later life caused contention within the scientific community and to the chagrin of his peers Burnet often made pessimistic proclamations about the future of science. In 1966 Burnet wrote an opinion article for  entitled \"Men or Molecules?\" in which he questioned the usefulness of , arguing that it had not and would not contribute anything of use to medicine and that manipulation of the genome as had been demonstrated in bacteria would do more harm to humans than good. Gustav Nossal subsequently described Burnet as \"a biologist with a love-hate affair with biochemistry, which led to a brief but damaging rejection of the worth of molecular biology.\"\nHe delivered the inaugural Oscar Mendelsohn lecture in 1971 at  and advocated policies for Australia such as population control, prevention of war, long-term plans for the management of the environment and natural resources, Aboriginal land rights, socialism, recycling, advertising bans on socially harmful products, and more regulation of the environment. He angrily denounced French nuclear testing in the Pacific, and after consistently voting for the ruling Liberal Party coalition as it ruled for the past few decades, signed an open letter backing the opposition Labor Party of , which took power in 1972. However, he soon spoke out against Whitlam's lack of action against tobacco advertising and French nuclear tests. Burnet often found himself frustrated with the refusal of politicians to base policy on long-term objectives, such as the sustainability of human life.\nIn 1971\u201372, he wrote four books, most notably, , which caused great controversy due to its strident attacks on molecular biology, cellular biology, and claims that cancer and various other diseases were incurable and that it was pointless to try to do so. He also predicted that scientific progress would end soon.\nBurnet spoke and wrote widely on the topic of human biology after his retirement, aiming to reach all strata of society. He courted the media as well as the scientific community, often leading to sensationalist or scientifically unrigorous report of his outspoken views. This often angered colleagues, who viewed him as abusing his stature to deliberately cause a stir.  In 1966 Burnet presented the , focusing on human biology. He provided a conceptual framework for sustainable development; 21 years later the definition provided by the  was almost identical. In 1970 he revised an earlier book which was published as ; it was followed by , which was published in 1978. The books discuss aspects of human biology, a topic which Burnet wrote on extensively in his later years. In  he argued that the roots of all human behaviour can be found in the behaviour of animals; in  he addressed issues of ageing, life, death and the future of mankind. The books strongly polarised the scientific community, and one reviewer described his ideas of sociobiology as \"extreme\" and giving \"a dismal, unappealing view of humanity\". In , he also called for society to accept euthanasia of ill older people, repeat violent criminals, and most controversially, abortion of pregnancies likely to result in disabled children, and infanticide of handicapped newborns. Knowing that there would be a strong backlash for such policies, he departed overseas for a two-month lecture series at the time of the book launch. In his absence, he was strongly assailed in newspaper letters and some correspondents compared his stance on infanticide to that of . At the same time, he also changed his stance on nuclear power and advocated its use, and the reinvestment of revenue for research into solar power. This about face angered the environmental movement.\nHis first wife, Edith Linda Druce, died from lymphoid leukaemia in 1973, after a four-year struggle. During her final years, Burnet refused all offers of lectures overseas to spend more time nursing his ailing wife. For a period after this he became very lethargic and reclusive, numbed by his wife's death. He then moved into Ormond College for company, and resumed beetle collecting, but for a year after her death, Burnet tried to alleviate his grief by writing mock letters to her once a week. Gradually he regained his enthusiasm and began writing again. In 1975, he travelled to California to deliver a series of lectures. In 1976 he married Hazel G. Jenkins, a widowed former singer from a business family in her 70s who was working in the microbiology department as a librarian, and moved out of Ormond College.\nIn 1978 Burnet decided to officially retire; in retirement he wrote two books. During this time, he missed his laboratory work, and he was constrained to social events and theorising. In 1982, Burnet was one of three contributors to , writing about genetic issues and their impact on the nation's impact. As a result of the success of the book, in early 1983, Burnet was appointed to the 70-person Australian Advisory Council of Elders to offer counsel to policymakers, but the group folded after several members became too frail or died.\nBurnet continued to travel and speak, but in the early 1980s, he and his wife became increasingly hampered by illness. Having surmised his illness two years earlier, in November 1984 he underwent surgery for . He made plans to resume scientific meetings, but was then taken ill again, with significant pain in his thorax and legs. Secondary lesions were found in June 1985 and declared to be inoperable and terminal. A supporter of euthanasia, Burnet was unfazed by his imminent death, and he died on 31 August at his son's home at  after two months' of illness. He was given a state funeral by the government of Australia; many of his distinguished colleagues from the Hall Institute such as Nossal and Fenner were pall-bearers, and he was buried near his paternal grandparents after a private family service at  in Koroit, near Port Fairy. Following his death he was honoured by the ; Prime Minister  took the highly unusual step of moving a condolence motion, an honour typically reserved for parliamentarians. Lady Hazel Burnet died in 1990.\nBurnet received extensive honours for his contributions to science and public life during his lifetime. He was  in the , received the Elizabeth II Coronation Medal in 1953, and was appointed to the  (OM) in the 1958 . In 1960 he was the first recipient of the honorary  award. He received a Gold and Silver Star from the Japanese  in 1961.  He was appointed  (KBE) in the , and received the Elizabeth II Jubilee Medal in 1977. In 1978 he was made a  (AK). He was only the fourth person to receive this honour.\nHe was a fellow or honorary member of 30 international Academies of Sciences. He received 10 honorary  degrees from universities including Cambridge, Harvard and Oxford, an honorary  degree from Hahnemann Medical College (now part of ), an honorary Doctor of Medical Science from the  and a  degree from the University of Melbourne. Including his Nobel, he received 19 medals or awards including the  and the  from the Royal Society and the ; he also received 33 international lectureships and 17 lectureships within Australia.\nAfter his death, Australia's largest communicable diseases research institute\u2014the  was renamed in his honour. The Burnet Clinical Research Unit of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute was also named in his honour in 1986. In 1975 his work on immunology was recognised by a 33-cent stamp released by . Seven Australian medical scientists were commemorated in the issue of a set of four Australian stamps released in 1995; he appears on the 45-cent stamp with fellow University of Melbourne graduate . He also appears on a  stamp that was issued in 1997. The centenary of his birth was celebrated in Australia in 1999; a statue of him was erected in Franklin Street, Traralgon; and several events were held in his honour including the release of a new edition of  by Oxford University Press.\nBurnet biographer Christopher Sexton suggests that Burnet's legacy is fourfold: (1) the scope and quality of his research; (2) his nationalistic attitude which led him to stay in Australia, leading to the development of science in Australia and inspiring future generations of Australian scientists; (3) his success establishing the reputation of Australian medical research worldwide; and (4) his books, essays and other writings. In spite of his sometimes controversial ideas on science and humanity,  has noted that \"Burnet's reputation is secure in his achievements as an experimentalist, a theoretician and a leader of the Australian scientific community.\"\n\n\n"},

Aged 17, he was awarded a senior scholarship to study medicine at the . As a medical undergraduate, he was never able to find a satisfactory explanation for the interaction of mind and body; he started to think about becoming a neuroscientist. He graduated (with first class honours) in 1925, and was awarded a  to study under  at , , where he received his Doctor of Philosophy in 1929.\nIn 1937 Eccles returned to Australia, where he worked on military research during . During this time Eccles was the director of Kanematsu Institute at , he and  gave research lectures at the , strongly influencing its intellectual environment. After the war, he became a professor at the  in New Zealand. From 1952 to 1962 he worked as a professor at the  (JCSMR) of the . The Eccles Institute of Neuroscience is headquartered in a new wing of the JCSMR building, constructed with the assistance of a $63M grant from the Commonwealth Government and completed in March 2012.\nIn the early 1950s, Eccles and his colleagues performed the research that would lead to his receiving the Nobel Prize. To study synapses in the peripheral nervous system, Eccles and colleagues used the stretch reflex as a model, which is easily studied because it consists of only two : a sensory neuron (the  fibre) and the . The sensory neuron synapses onto the motor neuron in the . When a current is passed into the sensory neuron in the , the motor neuron innervating the quadriceps produced a small  (EPSP). When a similar current is passed through the , the opposing muscle to the quadriceps, an  (IPSP) is produced in the quadriceps motor neuron. Although a single EPSP was not enough to fire an  in the motor neuron, the sum of several EPSPs from multiple sensory neurons synapsing onto the motor neuron can cause the motor neuron to fire, thus contracting the quadriceps. On the other hand, IPSPs could subtract from this sum of EPSPs, preventing the motor neuron from firing.\nApart from these seminal experiments, Eccles was key to a number of important developments in . Until around 1949, Eccles believed that  was primarily electrical rather than chemical. Although he was wrong in this hypothesis, his arguments led him and others to perform some of the experiments which proved chemical synaptic transmission.  and Eccles worked together on some of the experiments which elucidated the role of  as a  in the brain.\nHe was appointed a  in 1958 in recognition of services to physiological research.\nHe won the  Award in 1963, the same year he won the Nobel Prize.\nIn 1964 he became an honorary member to the , and in 1966 he moved to the United States to work at the  in Chicago. Unhappy with the working conditions there, he left to become a professor at the  from 1968 until he retired in 1975. After retirement, he moved to Switzerland and wrote on the .\nIn 1981, Eccles became a founding member of the .\nIn 1990 he was appointed a  of the  (AC) in recognition of service to science, particularly in the field of neurophysiology. He died in 1997 in , , Switzerland.\nIn  (1973), Eccles summarises his philosophy: \"Now before discussing brain function in detail I will at the beginning give an account of my philosophical position on the so-called 'brain-mind problem' so that you will be able to relate the experimental evidence to this philosophical position. I have written at length on this philosophy in my book . In Fig. 6-1 you will be able to see that I fully accept the recent philosophical achievements of  with his concept of three worlds. I was a , now I am a ! Cartesian dualism has become unfashionable with many people. They embrace  to escape the enigma of brain-mind interaction with its perplexing problems. But Sir Karl Popper and I are , and what is more, ! The three worlds are very easily defined. I believe that in the classification of Fig. 6-1 there is nothing left out. It takes care of everything that is in existence and in our experience. All can be classified in one or other of the categories enumerated under Worlds 1, 2 and 3.\n\n\"In Fig. 6-1, World 1 is the world of physical objects and states. It comprises the whole cosmos of matter and energy, all of biology including human brains, and all artifacts that man has made for coding information, as for example, the paper and ink of books or the material base of works of art. World 1 is the total world of the materialists. They recognise nothing else. All else is fantasy.\n\"World 2 is the world of states of consciousness and subjective knowledge of all kinds. The totality of our perceptions comes in this world. But there are several levels. In agreement with Polten, I tend to recognise three kinds of levels of World 2, as indicated in Fig. 6-2, but it may be more correct to think of it as a spectrum.\nFIG. 6-2, World of Consciousness\n\"The first level (outer sense) would be the ordinary perceptions provided by all our sense organs, hearing and touch and sight and smell and pain. All of these perceptions are in World 2, of course: vision with light and colour; sound with music and harmony; touch with all its qualities and vibration; the range of odours and tastes, and so on. These qualities do not exist in World 1, where correspondingly there are but electromagnetic waves, pressure waves in the atmosphere, material objects, and chemical substances.\n\"In addition there is a level of , which is the world of more subtle perceptions. It is the world of your emotions, of your feelings of joy and sadness and fear and anger and so on. It includes all your memory, and all your imaginings and planning into the future. In fact there is a whole range of levels which could be described at length. All the subtle experiences of the human person are in this inner sensory world. It is all private to you but you can reveal it in linguistic expression, and by gestures of all levels of subtlety.\n\"Finally, at the core of World 2 there is the  or , which is the basis of our unity as an experiencing being throughout our whole lifetime.\n\"This World 2 is our . Our conscious experiences are the basis of our knowledge of World 1, which is thus a world of , a derivative world. Whenever I am doing a scientific experiment, for example, I have to plan it cognitively, all in my thoughts, and then consciously carry out my plan of action in the experiment. Finally I have to look at the results and evaluate them in thought. For example, I have to see the traces of the oscilloscope and their photographic records or hear the signals on the loudspeaker. The various signals from the recording equipment have to be received by my sense organs, transmitted to my brain, and so to my consciousness, then appropriately measured and compared before I can begin to think about the significance of the experimental results. We are all the time, in every action we do, incessantly playing backwards and forwards between World 1 and World 2.\n\"And what is World 3? As shown in Fig. 6-1 it is the whole world of culture. It is the world that was created by man and that reciprocally made man. This is my message in which I follow Popper unreservedly. The whole of language is here. All our means of communication, all our intellectual efforts coded in books, coded in the artistic and technological treasures in the museums, coded in every artefact left by man from primitive times\u2014this is World 3 right up to the present time. It is the world of civilisation and culture. Education is the means whereby each human being is brought into relation with World 3. In this manner he becomes immersed in it throughout life, participating in the heritage of mankind and so becoming fully human. World 3 is the world that uniquely relates to man. It is the world which is completely unknown to animals. They are blind to all of World 3. I say that without any reservations. This is then the first part of my story.\n\"Now I come to consider the way in which the three worlds interact...\"\nDespite these words, in his late book , Eccles proposed a dualistic mechanism of mind.\nEccles had nine children. Eccles married Irene Miller Eccles (1904-2002) in 1928 and divorced in 1968. After his divorce in 1968, Eccles married Helena T\u00e1bor\u00edkov\u00e1; a fellow neuropsychologist and M.D. of Charles University. The two often collaborated in research and they remained married until his death. Eccles died on 2 May 1997 in his home of . He was buried in Contra, Switzerland.\n"},

His family returned to Sydney, Australia, when he was six months old. As a child he lived in a flat with his sister, a nanny, and a maid while his parents lived in an adjoining flat.  In 1916 they moved to a house in  that many years later became a nursing home, Lulworth House, the residents of which included , , and White's partner .\nAt the age of four, White developed asthma, a condition that had taken the life of his maternal grandfather. White's health was fragile throughout his childhood, which precluded his participation in many childhood activities.\nHe loved the theatre, which he first visited at an early age (his mother took him to see  at the age of six). This love was expressed at home when he performed private rites in the garden and danced for his mother's friends.\nAt the age of five, he attended kindergarten at Sandtoft in , in Sydney's .\nAt the age of ten, White was sent to , a boarding school in  in the  of New South Wales, in an attempt to abate his asthma. It took him some time to adjust to the presence of other children. At boarding school, he started to write plays. Even at this early age, White wrote about palpably adult themes. In 1924, the boarding school ran into financial trouble, and the headmaster suggested for White to be sent to a  in England, a suggestion that his parents accepted.\nWhite struggled to adjust to his new surroundings at , England. He later described it as \"a four-year prison sentence\". White withdrew socially and had a limited circle of acquaintances. Occasionally, he would holiday with his parents at European locations, but their relationship remained distant. However he did spend time with his cousin Jack Withycombe during this period, and Jack's daughter  became a mentor to him while he was writing his first book of poems,  between the years 1927\u201329.\nWhile at school in London, White made one close friend, Ronald Waterall, an older boy who shared similar interests. White's biographer, , wrote that \"the two men would walk, arm-in-arm, to London shows; and stand around stage doors crumbing for a glimpse of their favourite stars, giving a practical demonstration of a chorus girl's high kick... with appropriate vocal accompaniment\". When Waterall left school, White withdrew again. He asked his parents if he could leave school to become an actor. The parents compromised and allowed him to finish school early if he came home to Australia to try life on the land. His parents felt that he should work on the land rather than become a writer and hoped that his work as a  would temper his artistic ambitions.\nWhite spent two years working as a  at Bolaro, a 73-square-kilometre (28\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) station near , on the edge of the , in southeastern Australia. Although he grew to respect the land and his health improved, it was clear that he was not cut out for this life.\nFrom 1932 to 1935, White lived in England, studying French and German literature at , . During his time at Cambridge he developed a romantic attraction to a young man who had come to King's College to become an Anglican priest. White dared not speak of his feelings for fear of losing the friendship and, like many other gay men of that period, he feared that his sexuality would doom him to a lonely life. Then, one night, the student priest, after an awkward liaison with two women, admitted to White that women meant nothing to him sexually. That became White's first love affair.\nDuring White's time at Cambridge he published a collection of poetry entitled , and wrote a play named , which was later performed by an amateur group (which included his sister Suzanne) at the tiny  in Sydney. After being admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1935, White briefly settled in London, where he lived in an area that was frequented by artists. There, the young author thrived creatively for a time, writing several unpublished works and reworking , a novel that he had written while jackarooing. In 1937, White's father died, leaving him ten thousand pounds in inheritance. The fortune enabled him to write full-time in relative comfort. Two more plays followed before he succeeded in finding a publisher for . The novel was received well in London but poorly in Australia. He began writing another novel, , but abandoned it before its completion after receiving negative comments, a decision that he later admitted regretting.\nIn 1936, White met the painter , 18 years his senior, who became an important influence in his life and work. The two men never became lovers but remained firm friends. In White's own words, \"He became what I most needed, an intellectual and aesthetic mentor\". They had many similarities: they were both gay and they both felt like outsiders in their own families; as a result they both had ambivalent feelings about their families and backgrounds, yet both maintained close and lifelong links with their families, particularly their mothers. They also both appreciated the benefits of social standing and connections and Christian symbolism and biblical themes are common in both artists' work.\nWhite dedicated his first novel  to De Maistre and acknowledged De Maistre's influence on his writing. In 1947, De Maistre's painting  was used as the cover for the first edition of White's . White bought many of De Maistre's paintings. In 1974 White gave all his paintings by De Maistre to the .\nTowards the end of the 1930s, White spent time in the United States, including , Massachusetts, and , which were artistic hotbeds at the time, where he wrote . By the time World War II broke out, he had returned to London and joined the British . He was accepted as an intelligence officer, and was posted to the Middle East. He served in Egypt, Palestine, and Greece before the war was over. While in the Middle East, he had an affair with a Greek army officer, , who was to become his life partner.\nWhite and Lascaris lived together in Cairo for six years before moving to a small farm purchased by White at , near Sydney, in 1948. After the death of White's mother in 1963, they moved into a large house, , in , where they lived for the rest of their lives.\nAfter the war, White once again returned to Australia, buying an old house in , now a Sydney suburb but then semi-rural. He named the house \"The Dogwoods,\" after trees he planted there. In this house, he settled down with Lascaris, the Greek he had met during the war. They lived there for 18 years, selling flowers, vegetables, milk, and cream as well as pedigreed puppies. During these years he started to make a reputation for himself as a writer, publishing  and  in the United States in 1955 and shortly after in the United Kingdom.  was released to rave reviews in the United States, but in what had become a typical pattern, it was panned in Australia. White had doubts about whether to continue writing after his books were largely dismissed in Australia (three of them having been called 'un-Australian' by critics), but, in the end, he decided to persevere. His first breakthrough in Australia came when his next novel, , won the inaugural .\nIn 1961, White published . It was to become both a bestseller and a prizewinner, gaining him a second Miles Franklin Award. In 1963, White and Lascaris decided to sell the house at Castle Hill. A number of White's works from the 1960s depict the fictional town of Sarsaparilla, including his collection of short stories, , and the play, . By now, he had clearly established his reputation as one of the world's great authors, but remained an essentially private person, resisting opportunities for interviews and public appearances although his circle of friends had widened significantly.\nIn 1968, White wrote , a searing character portrait of an artist. Many people drew links to the Sydney painter  (1904\u201384) and White's friend, the painter , but White denied the connections. Patrick White was an art collector who had, as a young man, been deeply impressed by his friends  and , and later said he wished he had been an artist.  By the mid-1960s, he had also become interested in encouraging dozens of young and less established artists, such as , , and . White was later friends with , the young star of Australian painting, in the 1970s. That friendship ended when White felt that Whiteley, a heroin addict, was deceitful and pushy about selling his paintings. A portrait of White by  won the 1962 .\nWhite decided not to accept any more prizes for his work, and he declined both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by  to work on a screenplay for  but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia's decision to participate in the . His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the , but in 1971, after losing to , he wrote to a friend: .\nNevertheless, in 1973, White did accept the Nobel Prize \"for an epic and psychological narrative art, which has introduced a new continent into literature\". His cause was said to have been championed by a Scandinavian diplomat resident in Australia. White enlisted Nolan to travel to Stockholm to accept the prize on his behalf. The award had an immediate impact on his career, as his publisher doubled the print run for  and gave him a larger advance for his next novel. White used the money from the prize to establish a trust to fund the , given annually to established creative writers who have received little public recognition. He was invited by the  to be seated on the floor of the House in recognition of his achievement. White declined, explaining that his nature could not easily adapt itself to such a situation. The last time such an invitation had been extended was in 1928, to .\nWhite was made  for 1974, but in a typically rebellious fashion, his acceptance speech encouraged Australians to spend the day reflecting on the state of the country. Privately, he was less than enthusiastic about it. In a letter to Marshall Best on 27 January 1974, he wrote: \"Something terrible happened to me last week. There is an organisation which chooses an Australian of the Year, who has to appear at an official lunch in  on . This year I was picked on as they had run through all the swimmers, tennis players, yachtsmen\".\nWhite and Lascaris hosted many dinner parties at Highbury, their Centennial Park home, in a leafy part of the affluent Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. In , his biographer  portrays White as a genial host but one who easily fell out with friends.\nWhite supported the conservative, business oriented  until the election of 's  government and, following the , he became particularly , making a rare appearance on national television to broadcast his views on the matter. White also publicly expressed his admiration for the historian , satirist , and unionist .\nDuring the 1970s, White's health began to deteriorate: his teeth were crumbling, his eyesight was failing, and he had chronic lung problems - however, he also became a more openly political person, and began sometimes commenting on current issues. He was among the first group of Companions of the  in 1975 but resigned in June 1976 in protest at the dismissal of the Whitlam government in November 1975 by the Governor-General Sir . In 1979, his novel  was shortlisted for the , but White requested that it to be removed to give younger writers a chance to win. (The prize was won by , who ironically was just four years younger than White.) Soon after, White announced that he had written his last novel, and from then on, he would write only for radio or the stage.\nDirector  introduced himself to White while walking down a Sydney street, some time after White had seen a politically loaded stage revue by Sharman, , which had been panned by Sydney newspaper critics, and had written a letter to the editor of a newspaper defending the show. White felt somewhat cautious at first, not least due to the gulf in age between them, but after a while the two men became friends and Sharman and his theatrical circle, as well as his visual style as a director, would inspire White to a couple of new plays, notably  with its satirical portrayal of a posh and vulgar upper-class Sydney society. A few years later, Sharman asked White if he could make a film of . White agreed and wrote the screenplay for the film.\nIn 1981, White published his autobiography, , which explored issues about which he had publicly said little such as his homosexuality, his dislike of the \"subservient\" attitude of Australian society towards Britain and the Royal family, and also the distance he had felt towards his mother. On , 1982, White addressed a crowd of 30,000 people, calling for a ban on  and for the destruction of .\nIn 1986 White released one last novel, , but it was published under the pen name \"Alex Xenophon Demirjian Gray\" with White named as editor.

In 1987, White wrote , with his musings on ageing and society's efforts to achieve aesthetic perfection. When David Marr finished his biography of White in July 1990, his subject spent nine days going over the details with him.\nWhite died in Sydney on 30 September 1990.\nIn 2009, The Sydney Theatre Company staged White's play . In 2010 White received posthumous recognition for his novel , which was shortlisted for the  for 1970.\nIn 2011 Fred Schepisi's  of  was released with screenplay adaptation by ,  playing the son Basil,  as the daughter Dorothy, and  as the dying matriarch Elizabeth Hunter. This is the first screen realisation of a White novel, fittingly the one that played a key role in the Swedish panel's choice of White as Nobel prize winner.\nIn 1970, White was offered a knighthood but declined it.\nBoth White and  were members of the first group of six people appointed  (AC) in the civil division, (now called the general division).

It has been claimed that the  theory was ridiculed by established scientists and doctors, who did not believe that any bacteria could live in the acidic environment of the stomach.

The first 30 out of 100 samples showed no support for their hypothesis. However, it was discovered that the lab technicians had been throwing out the cultures after 2 days. This was standard practice for throat swabs where other organisms in the mouth rendered cultures as not useful after 2 days. Due to other hospital work, the lab technicians did not have time to immediately throw out the 31st test on the second day, and so it stayed from Thursday through to the Monday. In this sample, they discovered the presence of H. pylori. It turns out that H. pylori grow more slowly than 2 days, and also that the stomach cultures are not contaminated by other organisms.\nIn 1983 they submitted their findings so far to the Gastroenterological Society of Australia, but the reviewers turned their paper down, rating it in the bottom 10% of those they received in 1983.\nAfter failed attempts to infect piglets in 1984, Marshall, after having a baseline  done, drank a broth containing cultured , expecting to develop, perhaps years later, an ulcer.

For this work, she was awarded the 2009 , sharing it with Greider and , becoming the first Australian woman Nobel laureate. She also worked in , and was controversially dismissed from the  Administration's .\n\nElizabeth Helen Blackburn, one of seven children, was born in , , on 26 November 1948 to parents who were both family physicians. Her family moved to the city of  when she was four, where she attended the Broadland House Church of England Girls' Grammar School (later amalgamated with ) until the age of sixteen. Upon her family's relocation to , she attended , and ultimately gained very high marks in the end-of-year final statewide matriculation exams. She went on to earn a  in 1970 and  in 1972, both from the  in the field of biochemistry. Blackburn then went to receive her  in 1975 from the , where she worked with Frederick Sanger developing methods to sequence DNA using RNA, as well as studying the bacteriophage . It was also here, the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge University, where Blackburn met her husband John Sedat. Blackburn's soon to be husband had taken a position at Yale, where she then decided to finish her postdoctoral. \u201cThus it was that love brought me to a most fortunate and influential choice: Joe Gall\u2019s lab at Yale.\u201d\nDuring her postdoctoral work at Yale, Blackburn was doing research on the protozoan  and noticed a repeating  at the end of the linear rDNA which varied in size Blackburn then noticed that this hexanucleotide at the end of the chromosome contained a TTAGGG sequence that was , and the terminal end of the chromosomes were palindromic. These characteristics allowed Blackburn and colleagues to conduct further research on the protozoan. Using the telomeric repeated end of , Blackburn and colleague Jack Szostak showed the unstable replicating plasmids of yeast were protected from degradation, proving that these sequences contained characteristics of telomeres. This research also proved the telomeric repeats of  were conserved evolutionarily between the species. Through this research, Blackburn and collaborators noticed the replication system for chromosomes was not likely to add to the lengthening of the telomere, and that the addition of these hexanucleotides to the chromosomes was likely due to the activity of an enzyme that is able to transfer specific functional groups. The proposition of a possible transferase-like enzyme led Blackburn and PhD student Carol W. Greider to the discovery of an enzyme with reverse transcriptase activity that was able to fill in the terminal ends of telomeres without leaving the chromosome incomplete and unable to divide without loss of the end of the chromosome. This 1985 discovery led to the purification of this enzyme in lab, showing the transferase-like enzyme contained both RNA and protein components. The RNA portion of the enzyme served as a template for adding the telomeric repeats to the incomplete telomere, and the protein added enzymatic function for the addition of these repeats.Through this breakthrough, the term \u201ctelomerase\u201d was given to the enzyme, solving the end-replication process that had troubled scientists at the time.\n works by adding base pairs to the overhang of DNA on the 3\u2019 end, extending the strand until DNA polymerase and an RNA primer can complete the complementary strand and successfully synthesize the double stranded DNA. Since DNA polymerase only synthesizes DNA in the leading strand direction, the shortening of the telomere results. Through their research, Blackburn and collaborators were able to show that the telomere is effectively replenished by the enzyme telomerase, which conserves cellular division by preventing the rapid loss of genetic information internal to the telomere, leading to cellular aging.\n\n\nOn January 1, 2016, Blackburn was interviewed about her studies, discovering telomerase, and her current research. When she was asked to recall the moment of telomerase discovery she stated:In 1978, Blackburn joined the faculty of the , in the Department of Molecular Biology. In 1990, she moved across the San Francisco Bay to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the  (UCSF), where she served as the Department Chair from 1993 to 1999 and was the Morris Herzstein Professor of Biology and Physiology at UCSF. Blackburn became a Professor Emeritus at UCSF at the end of 2015.\nBlackburn, co-founded the company Telomere Health which offers telomere length testing to the public, but later severed ties with the company.\nIn 2015, Elizabeth Blackburn was announced as the new President of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. \u201cFew scientists garner the kind of admiration and respect that Dr. Blackburn receives from her peers for her scientific accomplishments and her leadership, service and integrity,\u201d says Irwin M. Jacobs, chairman of Salk's Board of Trustees, on Blackburn's appointment as President of the Institute. \u201cHer deep insight as a scientist, her vision as a leader, and her warm personality will prove invaluable as she guides the Salk Institute on its continuing journey of discovery.\u201d \u00a0In 2017, she announced her plans to retire from the Salk Institute the following year.\nFor their research and contributions to the understanding of telomeres and the enzyme telomerase, Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider, and Jack Szostaks were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The substantial research on the effects of chromosomal protection from telomerase, and the impact this has on cellular division has been a revolutionary catalyst in the field of molecular biology. For example, the addition of telomerase to cells that do not possess this enzyme has shown to bypass the limit of cellular aging in those cells, thereby linking this enzyme to reduced cellular aging. The addition of telomerase, and the presence of the enzyme in cancer cells has been shown to provide an immunity mechanism for the cell in proliferating, linking the transferase activity to increased cellular growth and reduced sensitivity for cellular signalling. The importance of discovering this enzyme has since sent led her continued research at the University of California San Francisco, where she studies the effect of telomeres and telomerase activity on cellular aging.\nBlackburn was appointed a member of the  in 2002. She supported human embryonic cell research, in opposition to the Bush Administration. Her Council terms were terminated by  directive on 27 February 2004. Dr. Blackburn believes that she was dismissed from the Council due to her disapproval of the Bush administration's position against stem cell research. This was followed by expressions of outrage over her removal by many scientists, 170 of whom signed an open letter to the president maintaining that she was fired because of political opposition to her advice.\nScientists and ethicists at the time even went as far to say that Blackburn's removal was in violation of Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which \u201crequires balance on such advisory bodies\u201d\n\"There is a growing sense that scientific research\u2014which, after all, is defined by the quest for truth\u2014is being manipulated for political ends,\" wrote Blackburn. \"There is evidence that such manipulation is being achieved through the stacking of the membership of advisory bodies and through the delay and misrepresentation of their reports.\"\nBlackburn serves on the Science Advisory Board of the Regenerative Medicine Foundation formerly known as the Genetics Policy Institute.\nBlackburn's first book  (2017) was co-authored with  Dr. Elissa Epel of Aging, Metabolism, and Emotions (AME) Center at the UCSF Center for Health and Community. Blackburn comments on aging reversal and care for one's telomeres through lifestyle: managing chronic stress, exercising, eating better and getting enough sleep; telomere testing, plus cautions and advice. While studying telomeres and the replenishing enzyme, telomerase, Blackburn discovered a vital role played by these protective caps that revolved around one central idea: aging of cells. The book hones in on many of the effects that poor health can have on telomeres and telomerase activity. Since telomeres shorten with every division of a cell, replenishing these caps is essential to long term cell growth. Through research and data, Blackburn explained that people that lead stressful lives exhibit less telomerase functioning in the body, which leads to a decrease in the dividing capabilities of the cell. Once telomeres shorten drastically, the cells can no longer divide, meaning the tissues they replenish with every division would therefore die out, highlighting the aging mechanism in humans. To increase telomerase activity in people with stress-filled lives, Blackburn suggests moderate exercise, even 15 minutes a day, which has been proven to stimulate telomerase activity and replenish the telomere.\nBlackburn also states that unhappiness in lives also has an effect on the shortening of telomeres. In a study done on divorced couples, their telomere length was \"significantly shorter\" compared to couples in healthy relationships, and Blackburn states, \"There's an obvious stressor... we are intensely social beings.\" She suggests to include positivity into our daily lives to increase health as well. While increasing the amount of exercise, decreasing stress, tobacco use, and maintaining a balanced sleep schedule, Blackburn explains that our telomeres can be drastically maintained and prevented from rapid shortening, leading to a decrease in the aging process of our cells. Blackburn also tells the readers to be wary of clinical pills who proclaim to lengthen or telomeres and protect the body from aging. She says that these pills and creams have no scientific proof of being anti-aging supplements, and that the key to preserving our telomeres and stimulating telomerase activity comes from leading a healthy life.\nIn recent years Blackburn and her colleagues have been investigating the effect of stress on telomerase and telomeres with particular emphasis on  meditation. She is also one of several biologists (and one of two Nobel Prize laureates) in the 1995 science documentary . Studies suggest that chronic psychological stress may accelerate ageing at the cellular level. Intimate partner violence was found to shorten telomere length in formerly abused women versus never abused women, possibly causing poorer overall health and greater morbidity in abused women.\nAt the University of California San Francisco, Blackburn currently researches telomeres and telomerase in many organisms, from yeast to human cells. The lab is focused on telomere maintenance, and how this has an impact on cellular aging. Many chronic diseases have been associated with the improper maintenance of these telomeres, thereby effecting cellular division, cycling, and impaired growth. At the cutting edge of telomere research, the Blackburn lab currently investigates the impact of limited maintenance of telomeres in cells through altering the enzyme telomerase.\nBlackburns awards and honors include:\nBlackburn was elected:\nIn 2007, Blackburn was listed among 's \nBlackburn splits her time living between La Jolla and  with her husband, scientist John W. Sedat, whom she met while at Cambridge, and has a son, Benjamin.

A pioneer in the field of labor legislation, he edited several treatises on labor legislation in Argentina and on the need for a universally recognized doctrine on the treatment of labor - among them, Centro de legislac\u00edon social y del trabajo (1927) [Center of Social and Labor Legislation], Trait\u00e9s internationaux de type social (1924), C\u00f3digo nacional del trabajo (three volumes, 1933) [National Code of Labor Law]. In the arena of practical affairs, Saavedra Lamas drafted legislation affecting labor in Argentina, supported the founding of the International Labor Organization in 1919, and presided over the ILO Conference of 1928 in Geneva while serving simultaneously as leader of the Argentine delegation.\nIn international law, his other field of major scholarly interest, he published \"La Crise de la codification et de la doctrine Argentine de droit international\" (1931); and he spoke, wrote, or drafted legislation on many subjects with international ramifications - among them, asylum, colonization, immigration, arbitration, and international peace. His brief Vida internacional, which he wrote at the age of seventy, is an urbane by-product of all this study and experience.\nSaavedra Lamas began his political career in 1906 as director of Public Credit and then became the secretary-general for the municipality of Buenos Aires in 1907. In 1908 he was elected to the first of two successive terms in Parliament. There he initiated legislation regarding coastal water rights, irrigation, sugar production, government finances, colonization, and immigration. His main interest, however, lay in foreign affairs. He provided leadership in saving Argentina's arbitration treaty with Italy, which almost foundered in 1907-1908, and eventually became the unofficial adviser to both the legislature and the foreign office on the analysis and implications of proposed foreign treaties. Saavedra Lamas though was also a controversial public figure as he was seen by the masses as an elitist patrician who was too conservative and favored British intervention, especially in railroad construction.\nAppointed minister of Justice and Education in 1915, he instituted educational reforms by integrating the different divisions of public education and by developing a curriculum at the intermediate level for the vocational and technical training of manpower needed in a developing industrial country.\nWhen General  became president of Argentina in 1932, he appointed Saavedra Lamas as foreign minister. In this post for six years, Saavedra Lamas brought international prestige to Argentina. He played an important role in every South American diplomatic issue of the middle thirties, induced Argentina to rejoin the League of Nations after an absence of thirteen years, and represented Argentina at virtually every international meeting of consequence during this period.\nHis work in ending the  between Paraguay and Bolivia (1932\u20131935) had not only local significance but generalized international importance as well. When he took over the foreign office, he immediately engaged in a series of moves to lay the diplomatic groundwork for a negotiated settlement of this dispute. In 1932 he initiated at Washington the Declaration of August 3 which put the American states on record as refusing to recognize any territorial change in the hemisphere brought about by force. Next, he drew up a Treaty of Nonaggression and Conciliation which was signed by six South American countries in October, 1933, and by all of the American countries at the Seventh Pan-American Conference at Montevideo two months later. In 1935 he organized mediation by six neutral American nations which resulted in the cessation of hostilities between Paraguay and Bolivia. Meanwhile, in 1934, Saavedra Lamas presented the South American Antiwar Pact to the League of Nations where it was well received and signed by eleven countries. Acclaimed for all of these efforts, he was elected president of the Assembly of the League of Nations in 1936.\nAfter his retirement from the foreign ministry in 1938, Saavedra Lamas returned to academic life, became president of the University of Buenos Aires for two years (1941\u20131943), and rounded out his career as a professor for an additional three years (1943\u20131946).\nSaavedra Lamas was known as a strict disciplinarian in his office, a logician at the conference table, a charming host in his home or his art gallery, and a man of sartorial elegance who wore, it is said, the highest collars in Buenos Aires. In addition to the , he was awarded the  and analogous honors from ten other countries.\nHe died in 1959 at the age of eighty from the effects of a brain hemorrhage.\nIn March 2014 his solid gold Nobel medal was put up for auction after being found in a South American pawn shop.\nIn August 2014 a project for rebuying his Nobel medal by the Argentine Nation was presented at the Argentine congress. His auctioned medal was later won and is now owned by a private Asian collector.\n\n"},

Luis Leloir is buried in , .\nLeloir's parents, Federico Augusto Rufino Leloir Bernal and Hortensia Aguirre de Leloir, traveled from Buenos Aires to Paris in the middle of 1906 with the intention of treating Federico's illness. However, Federico died in late August, and a week later Luis was born in an old house at 81 V\u00edctor Hugo Road in Paris, a few blocks away from the . After returning to Argentina in 1908, Leloir lived together with his eight siblings on their family's extensive property  that his grandparents had purchased after their immigration from the  of northern : El Tuy\u00fa comprises 400\u00a0km of sandy land along the coastline from  to  which has since become a popular tourist attraction.\nDuring his childhood, the future Nobel Prize winner found himself observing natural phenomena with particular interest; his schoolwork and readings highlighted the connections between the natural sciences and biology. His education was divided between Escuela General San Mart\u00edn (primary school),  (secondary school), and for a few months at  in . His grades were unspectacular, and his first stint in college ended quickly when he abandoned his architectural studies that he had begun in Paris' .\nIt was during the 1920s that Leloir invented  (golf sauce). After being served prawns with the usual sauce during lunch with a group of friends at the Ocean Club in Mar del Plata, Leloir came up with a peculiar combination of ketchup and mayonnaise to spice up his meal. With the financial difficulties that later plagued Leloir's laboratories and research, he would joke, \"If I had patented that sauce, we'd have a lot more money for research right now.\"\nAfter returning again to , Leloir obtained his Argentine citizenship and joined the Department of Medicine at the  in hopes of receiving his doctorate. However, he got off to a rocky start, requiring four attempts to pass his anatomy exam. He finally received his diploma in 1932 and began his residency in the  and his medical internship in Ramos Mej\u00eda hospital. After some initial conflicts with colleagues and complications in his method of treating patients, Leloir decided to dedicate himself to research in the laboratory, claiming that \"we could do little for our patients... antibiotics, psychoactive d, and all the new therapeutic agents were unknown [at the time].\"\nIn 1933, he met , who pointed Leloir towards investigating in his doctoral thesis the  and carbohydrate metabolism. Houssay happened to be friends with , the brother-in-law of , one of Leloir's cousins. Following the recommendation of Udaondo, Leloir began working with Houssay, who in 1947 would later win the . The two would develop a close relationship, collaborating on various projects until Houssay's death in 1971; in his lecture after winning the Nobel Prize, Leloir claimed that his \"whole research career has been influenced by one person, Prof. Bernardo A. Houssay\".\nAfter only two years, Leloir received recognition from the medical department at UBA for having produced the best doctoral thesis. Feeling that his knowledge in fields such as , , , and  was lacking, he continued attending classes at the University as a part-time student. In 1936 he traveled to England to begin advanced studies at the , under the supervision of another Nobel Prize winner, Sir , who had obtained that distinction in 1929 for his work in  and in revealing the critical role of  in maintaining good health. Leloir's research in the Biochemical Laboratory of Cambridge centered around , more specifically the effects of  and  on succinic dehydrogenase; from this moment Leloir began to specialize in researching carbohydrate metabolism.\nLeloir returned to Buenos Aires in 1937 after his brief stay at Cambridge. 1943 saw Leloir marry; Luis Leloir and Amelia Zuberbuhler (1920-2013) would later have a daughter also named Amelia. However, his return to Argentina was amidst conflict and strife;  Houssay had been expelled from the University of Buenos Aires for signing a public petition opposing the  regime in  and the military government led  by . Leloir fled to the , where he assumed the position of associate professor in the Department of  at , collaborating with  and  and thereafter worked with  at the College of Physicians and Surgeons,  as a research assistant. Leloir would later credit Green with instilling within him the initiative to establish his own research in Argentina.\nIn 1945, Leloir ended his exile and returned to Argentina to work under Houssay at the , which Leloir would direct from its creation in 1947 by businessman and patron . Initially, the institute was composed of five rooms, a bathroom, central hall, patio, kitchen, and changing room. During the final years of the 1940s, although lacking financial resources and operating with very low-cost teams, Leloir's successful experiments would reveal the chemical origins of sugar synthesis in  as well as the  of  in the liver; together with J. M. Mu\u00f1oz, he produced an active cell-free system, a first in scientific research. It had initially been assumed that in order to study a cell, scientists could not separate it from its host organism, as oxidation could only occur in intact cells. Along the way, Mu\u00f1oz and Leloir, unable to procure the costly centrifuge needed to separate cell contents, improvised by spinning a tire stuffed with salt and ice.\nBy 1947 he had formed a team that included \nCaputto, Enrico Cabib, Ra\u00fal Trucco, Alejandro Paladini, Carlos Cardini and Jos\u00e9 Luis Reissig, with whom he investigated and discovered why a malfunctioning kidney and  helped cause . That same year,  his colleague , in his investigations of the , made discoveries regarding carbohydrate storage and its subsequent transformation into a reserve energy form in organisms.\nAt the beginning of 1948, Leloir and his team identified the sugar nucleotides that were fundamental to the metabolism of carbohydrates, turning the Instituto Campomar into a biochemistry institution well known throughout the world. Immediately thereafter, Leloir received the Argentine Scientific Society Prize,  one of the many awards he would receive both in Argentina and internationally. During this time, his team dedicated itself to the study of ; Leloir and his colleagues elucidated the primary mechanisms of galactose metabolism (now coined the ) and determined the cause of galactosemia, a serious  that resulted in .\nThe following year, he reached an agreement with Rolando Garc\u00eda, dean of the  at UBA, which named Leloir, Carlos Eugenio Cardini and Enrico Cabib as titular professors in the University's newly founded Biochemical Institute. The Institute would help develop scientific programs in budding Argentine universities as well as attract researchers and scholars from the United States, , England, France, Spain, and other Latin American countries.\nFollowing Campomar's death in 1957, Leloir and his team applied to the  in the United States desperate for funding, and surprisingly was accepted. In 1958, the Institute found a new home in a former all-girls school, a donation from the Argentine government. As Leloir and his research gained greater prominence, further research came from the Argentine Research Council, and the Institute would later become associated with the University of Buenos Aires.\nAs his work in the laboratory was coming to an end, Leloir continued his teaching position in the Department of Natural Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires, taking a hiatus only to complete his studies at Cambridge and at the Enzyme Research Laboratory in the United States.\nIn 1983, Leloir became one of the founding members of the Third World Academy of Sciences, later renamed the .\nOn December 2, 1970, Leloir received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry from the King of  for his discovery of the  in , becoming only the third Argentine to receive the prestigious honor in any field. In his acceptance speech at , he borrowed from 's famous 1940 speech to the  and remarked, \"never have I received so much for so little\". Leloir and his team reportedly celebrated by drinking champagne from test tubes, a rare departure from the humility and frugality that characterized the atmosphere of Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Campomar under Leloir's direction. The $80,000 prize money was spent directly on research, and when asked about the significance of his achievement, Leloir responded:\nLeloir published a short autobiography, entitled \"Long Ago and Far Away\" in the 1983 . The title, Leloir claims, is derived from one of 's novels that depicted the country wildlife and scenery of Leloir's childhood.\nHe died in Buenos Aires December 2, 1987, of a heart attack soon after returning to his home from the laboratory, and is buried in . , a friend and colleague of Leloir, claims that his lasting legacy was proving that \"scientific research on an international level, although precarious, was possible in an underdeveloped country in the middle of political strife\" and credits Leloir's vigilance and will for his ultimate success. With his research in dire financial straits, Leloir often resorted to homemade gadgets and contraptions to continue his work in the laboratory. In one instance, Leloir reportedly used waterproof cardboard to create makeshift gutters in order to protect his laboratory's library from the rain.\nLeloir was known for his humility, focus and consistency, described by many as a \"true monk in science\". Every morning his wife Amelia would drive him in their  and drop him off at 1719 Juli\u00e1n Alvarez Street, location of Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Campomar, with Leloir wearing the same worn out, gray overalls. He worked sitting on the same straw seat for decades and encouraged colleagues to eat lunch in the laboratory to save time, bringing enough meat stew to share with everyone. Indeed, despite Leloir's frugality and extreme dedication to his research, he was a sociable man, claiming not to like working alone.\nThe Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Campomar has since been renamed , and has grown to become a 21,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (2,000\u00a0m) building with 20 senior researchers, 42 technicians and administrative personnel, 8 post doctorate fellows, and 20 Ph.D. candidates.

His parents were M\u00e1xima (Vapniarsky) and L\u00e1zaro Milstein, a  immigrant. He graduated from the  and obtained a PhD under Professor Stoppani (Professor of ). Thereafter, he was a member of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, England, and held dual Argentine and British citizenship. In 1956, he received an award from the Sociedad Bioqu\u00edmica Argentina for his work on  with the  aldehyde dehydrogenase. In 1958, funded by the , he joined the  Department at the  at  to work for a PhD under  on the mechanism of metal activation of the enzyme . During this work, he collaborated with  whose group he joined with a short-term  appointment.\nThe major part of Milstein's research career was devoted to studying the structure of antibodies and the mechanism by which antibody diversity is generated. It was as part of this quest that, in 1975, he worked with  (a postdoctoral fellow in his laboratory) to develop the  technique for the production of \u2014a discovery recognized by the award of the 1984 . This discovery led to an enormous expansion in the exploitation of antibodies in science and medicine.\nMilstein himself made many major contributions to improvements and developments in monoclonal antibody technology\u2014especially in the use of  to provide markers that allow distinction between different cell types. In collaboration with Claudio Cuello, Milstein helped lay the foundation for the use of monoclonal antibodies as probes for the investigation of the pathological pathways in neurological disorders as well as many other diseases. Milstein and Cuello's work also enabled the use of monoclonal antibodies to enhance the power of immuno-based diagnostic tests. In addition, Milstein foresaw the potential wealth of ligand-binding reagents that could result from applying recombinant  technology to monoclonal antibodies and inspired the development of the field of antibody engineering which was to lead to safer and more powerful monoclonal antibodies for use as therapeutics.\nMilstein's early work on antibodies focused on their diversity at the amino acid level, as well as on the disulfide bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies, where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted  that contained a signal sequence. The development of the  technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of  of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody . In this process, localized mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved , which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in recent years was devoted to characterizing this mutational process, with a view to understanding its mechanism. He contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.\nQuite apart from his own achievements, Milstein acted as a guide and inspiration to many in the antibody field, as well as devoting himself to assisting science and scientists in less developed countries. It is also worth mentioning, that even though the Nobel Prize would have made him a wealthy man, Milstein did not patent his enormous discovery since he believed that it was mankind's intellectual property. According to his beliefs, his work did not have any economic interest, only scientific.\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize 1984, Milstein was elected a , was a fellow of  from 1980 to 2002, awarded the  from  in 1980, won the  in 1989, and became a  in 1995.

In 1912, as a first-year research student at Cambridge, W. L. Bragg, while strolling by the river, had the insight that crystals made from parallel sheets of atoms would not diffract X-ray beams that struck their surface at most angles because X-rays deflected by collisions with atoms would be out of phase, cancelling one another out. However, when the X-ray beam stuck at an angle at which the distances it passed between atomic sheets in the crystal equalled the X-ray's wavelength then those deflected would be in phase and produce a spot on a nearby film. From this insight he wrote the simple  that relates the wavelength of the X-ray and the distance between atomic sheets in a simple crystal to the angles at which an impinging X-ray beam would be reflected.\nHis father built an  in which a crystal could be rotated to precise angles while measuring the energy of reflections. This enabled father and son to measure the distances between the atomic sheets in a number of simple crystals. They calculated the spacing of the atoms from the weight of the crystal and the , which enabled them to measure the wavelengths of the X-rays produced by different metallic targets in the X-ray tubes. W. H. Bragg reported their results at meetings and in a paper, giving credit to \"his son\" (unnamed) for the equation, but not as a co-author, which gave his son \"some heartaches\", .\nBragg was commissioned early in  in the  as a  of the . In 1915 he was seconded to the  to develop a method to localise enemy artillery from the boom of their firing. On 2 September 1915 his brother was killed during the . Shortly afterwards, he and his father were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. He was 25 years old and remains the youngest science laureate. The problem with  was that the heavy guns boomed at too low a frequency to be detected by a microphone. After months of frustrating failure he and his group devised a hot wire air wave detector that solved the problem. In this work he was aided by , ,  and Henry Harold Hemming. British sound ranging was very effective; there was a unit in every British Army and their system was adopted by the Americans when they entered the war. For his work during the war he was awarded the  and appointed . He was also  on 16 June 1916, 4 January 1917 and 7 July 1919.\nHot wire sound ranging was used in  during which he served as a civilian adviser.\nBetween the wars, from 1919 to 1937, he worked at the  as  of Physics. He became the director of the  in Teddington in 1937.\nAfter World War II, Bragg returned to Cambridge, splitting the  into research groups. He believed that \"the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants\".\nWhen demobilised he returned to crystallography at Cambridge. They had agreed that father would study organic crystals, son would investigate inorganic compounds. In 1919 when , a long-time family friend, moved to Cambridge, Lawrence Bragg replaced him as Langworthy Professor of Physics at the . He recruited an excellent faculty, including former sound rangers, but he believed that his knowledge of physics was weak and he had no classroom experience. The students, many veterans, were critical and rowdy. He was deeply shaken but with family support he pulled himself together and prevailed. He and R. W. James measured the absolute energy of reflected X-rays, which validated a formula derived by C. G. Darwin before the war. Now they could determine the number of electrons in the reflecting targets, and they were able to decipher the structures of more complicated crystals like silicates. It was still difficult: requiring repeated guessing and retrying. In the late 1920s they eased the analysis by using  on the data.\nIn 1930 he became deeply disturbed while weighing a job offer from Imperial College, London. His family rallied around and he recovered his balance while they spent 1931 in Munich, where he did research.\nHe became director of the  in Teddington in 1937, bringing some co-workers along. However, administration and committees took much of his time away from the workbench.\nRutherford died and the search committee named Lawrence Bragg as next in the line of the  who direct the . The Laboratory had an eminent history in atomic physics and some members were wary of a crystallographer, which Bragg surmounted by even-handed administration. He worked on improving the interpretation of diffraction patterns. In the small crystallography group was a refugee research student without a mentor: . He showed Bragg X-ray diffraction data from , which suggested that the structure of giant biological molecules might be deciphered. Bragg appointed Perutz as his research assistant and within a few months obtained additional support with a grant from the . The work was suspended during the Second World War when Perutz was interned as an enemy alien and then worked in military research.\nDuring the war the Cavendish offered a shortened graduate course which emphasised the electronics needed for . Bragg worked on the structure of metals and consulted on sonar and sound ranging, they still used the Tucker microphone. He became Sir Lawrence in 1941. His father died in 1942, during which Bragg served for six months as Scientific Liaison Officer to Canada. He organised periodic conferences on X-ray analysis, which was widely used in military research.\nAfter the war he led in the formation of the  and was elected its first president. He reorganised the Cavendish into units to reflect his conviction that \"the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants, helped by one or more first-class instrument mechanics and a workshop in which the general run of apparatus can be constructed.\" Senior members of staff now had offices, telephones and secretarial support. The scope of the department was enlarged with a new unit on radio astronomy. His own work focused on the structure of metals, using both X-rays and the . In 1947 he persuaded the  (MRC) to support what he described as the \"gallant attempt\" to determine protein structure as the , initially consisting of Perutz,  and two assistants. Bragg worked with them, by 1960 they had resolved the structure of  to the atomic level. After this he was less involved; their analysis of  was easier after they incorporated two mercury atoms as markers in each molecule. The first monumental triumph of the MRC was decoding the structure of DNA by  and . Bragg announced the discovery at a  on proteins in Belgium on 8 April 1953, it went unreported by the press. He then gave a talk at  in London on Thursday 14 May 1953, which resulted in an article by  in the  of London on Friday 15 May 1953, entitled \"Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life\". Bragg nominated Crick, Watson and  for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; Wilkins' share recognised the contribution of X-ray crystallographers at . Among them was , whose \"\" showed that DNA was a double , not the triple helix that  had proposed. Franklin died before the prize (which only goes to living people) was awarded.\nIn 1953 the Braggs moved into the elegant flat for the Resident Professor in the  in London, the position his father had occupied when he died. In 1934 and 1961 Lawrence had delivered the  and since 1938 he had been Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Institution, delivering an annual lecture. His father's successors had weakened the Institution, so Bragg had to rebuild it. He bolstered finances by enlisting corporate sponsors, the traditional Friday Evening Discourses were followed by a dinner party for the speaker and carefully selected possible patrons, more than 120 of them each year. \"Two of these Discourses in 1965 gave him particular pleasure. On 7 May, Lady Bragg, who had been a member of the Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce (1951\u201355) and was Chairman of the , lectured on 'Changing patterns in marriage and divorce'; and on 15 November, Bragg listened with evident pride to the Discourse on 'Oscillations and noise in jet engines' given by his engineer-son , who was then Chief Scientist at Rolls Royce Ltd and later became Vice-Chancellor of .\" He also introduced a programme of highly regarded Schools' Lectures, enlivened by the elaborate demonstrations that were a hallmark of the Institution. He gave three of these lectures on \"electricity\".\nHe continued research in the Institution by recruiting a small group to work the Davy-Faraday Laboratory in the basement and in the adjoining house, supported by grants he obtained. A visitor to the laboratory succeeded in inserting heavy metals into the enzyme ; the structure of its crystal was solved in 1965 at the Royal Institution by  and his coworkers, with the computations on the 9,040 reflections performed on the digital computer at the University of London, which greatly facilitated the work. Two of the illustrations of the positioning of amino acids in the chain were drawn by Bragg. Unlike myoglobin, in which nearly 80 per cent of the amino-acid residues are in the  conformation, in lysozyme the alpha-helix content is only about 40 per cent of the amino-acid residues found in four main stretches. Other stretches are of the , a conformation that they had proposed earlier. In this conformation, every third peptide is hydrogen-bonded back to the first peptide, thus forming a ring containing ten atoms. They had the complete structure of an enzyme in time for Bragg's 75th birthday. He became Professor Emeritus in 1966.\nX-ray analysis of protein structure flourished in subsequent years, determining the structures of scores of proteins in laboratories around the world. Twenty eight Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work using X-ray analysis. The disadvantage of the method is that it must be done on crystals, which precludes seeing changes in shape when enzymes bind substrates and the like. This problem was solved by the development of another line Bragg had initiated, using modified electron microscopes to image single frozen molecules: .\nIn his long association with the  he was:\nIn 1921 he married Alice Hopkinson (1899\u20131989), a cousin of a friend who had been killed in the war. They had four children, the engineer  (1923\u20132014), David William (1926\u20132005), Margaret Alice, born 1931, (who married the diplomat ) and Patience Mary, born 1935. Alice was on the staff at  until Bragg was appointed director of the National Physical Laboratory in 1937. She was active in a number of public bodies and served as  from 1945-46.\nBragg's hobbies included drawing \u2013 family letters were illustrated with lively sketches \u2013 painting, literature and a lifelong interest in gardening. When he moved to London, he missed having a garden and so worked as a part-time gardener, unrecognised by his employer, until a guest at the house expressed surprise at seeing him there. He died at a hospital near his home at , , Suffolk. He was buried in ; his son David is buried in the  in Cambridge, where Bragg's friend, who had he survived would have been his brother-in-law, Rudolph Cecil Hopkinson is also buried.\nIn August 2013, Bragg's relative, the broadcaster , presented a BBC Radio 4 programme (\"Bragg on the Braggs\") on the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics winners.\nBragg was elected a  \u2013 \"a qualification that makes other ones irrelevant\".

Although Graeme Hunter, in his book on Bragg , argued that he was more a crystallographer than a physicist, Bragg's lifelong activity showed otherwise\u2014he was more of a physicist than anything else.

It was Florey and Chain who actually made a useful and effective drug out of penicillin, after the task had been abandoned as too difficult.\nFlorey's discoveries, along with the discoveries of Fleming and Ernst Chain, are estimated to have saved over 200 million lives, and he is consequently regarded by the Australian scientific and medical community as one of its greatest figures. , Australia's longest-serving , said, \"In terms of world well-being, Florey was the most important man ever born in Australia.\"\nHoward Florey was born in , a southern suburb of , , the youngest of three children and the only son. His father, Joseph Florey, was an English immigrant, and his mother Bertha Mary Florey was a second-generation Australian.\nFlorey was educated at  Preparatory School (now ) and then , where he excelled in chemistry and physics, but not mathematics.

His whole face, eyes and scalp were swollen to the extent that he had had an eye removed to relieve the pain. Within a day of being given penicillin, he started to recover. However, the researchers did not have enough penicillin to help him to a full recovery, and he relapsed and died. Because of this experience and the difficulty in producing penicillin, the researchers changed their focus to children, who could be treated with smaller quantities of penicillin.\nFlorey's research team investigated the large-scale production of the mould and efficient extraction of the active ingredient, succeeding to the point where, by 1945, penicillin production was an industrial process for the Allies in World War II. However, Florey said that the project was originally driven by scientific interests, and that the medicinal discovery was a bonus:\nFlorey shared the  in 1945 with Ernst Boris Chain and Alexander Fleming.

For his contributions to Australian science, he was made the first  in 1960, and in 1978 a Knight of the . He was recognised internationally for his achievements: in addition to the Nobel, he received the  and the  and  from the , honorary doctorates, and distinguished service honours from the  and Japan.\nBurnet was born in , ; his father, Frank Burnet, a Scottish emigrant to Australia, was the manager of the Traralgon branch of the Colonial Bank. His mother Hadassah Burnet (n\u00e9e Mackay) was the daughter of a middle-class Scottish immigrant, and met his father when Frank was working in the town of . Frank was 36, and 14 years older than Hadassah. The family was socially conservative Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Frank Macfarlane Burnet was the second of seven children and from childhood was known as \"Mac\". He had an older sister, two younger sisters and three younger brothers. The eldest daughter Doris had a mental disability that consumed most of Hadassah's time and the family saw Doris's condition as an unspoken stigma, discouraging the other children from inviting friends home, lest they come across the eldest daughter. From his early years in Traralgon, Mac enjoyed exploring the environment around him, particularly Traralgon Creek. He first attended a private school run by a single teacher before starting at the government primary school at the age of 7. Mac was distant from his father\u2014who liked to spend his free time fishing and playing golf\u2014from a young age. He preferred bookish pursuits from a young age and was not enamoured of sport, and by the age of eight was old enough to analyse his father's character; Mac disapproved of Frank and saw him as a hypocrite who espoused moral principles and put on a facade of uprightedness, while associating with businessmen of dubious ethics. Hadassah was preoccupied with Doris, so Mac developed a rather solitary personality.\nThe Burnets moved to  in 1909, when Frank was posted to be the bank manager there, having declined a post in London. Burnet was interested in the wildlife around the nearby ; he joined the  in 1910 and enjoyed all outdoor activities. While living in Terang, he began to collect  and study biology. He read biology articles in the , which introduced him to the work of . During his early teens, the family took annual holidays to , where Burnet spent his time observing and recording the behaviour of the wildlife. He was educated at Terang State School and attended Sunday school at the local church, where the priest encouraged him to pursue scholastic studies and awarded him a book on ants as a reward for his academic performance. He advised Frank to invest in Mac's education and he won a full scholarship to board and study at , one of Victoria's most exclusive private schools. Starting there in 1913, Burnet was the only boarder with a full scholarship. He did not enjoy his time there among the scions of the ruling upper class; while most of his peers were brash and sports-oriented, Burnet was bookish and not athletically inclined, and found his fellow students to be arrogant and boorish. During this period he kept his beetle-collecting and disapproval of his peers a secret and mixed with his schoolmates out of necessity. Nevertheless, his academic prowess gained him privileges, and he graduated in 1916, placing first in his school overall, and in history, English, chemistry and physics. The typical university path for a person of his social background was to pursue studies in theology, law or medicine. By this time, he was becoming disillusioned with religion and chose medicine. Due to World War I, military service was a possibility and he felt that a medical background would increase his chances of being given a non-combat post.\nFrom 1918, Burnet attended the , where he lived in  on a residential scholarship. There, he read more of Darwin's work and was influenced by the ideas of science and society in the writings of . He enjoyed his time at university and spent much of his free time reading biology books in the library to feed his passion for scientific knowledge. He also had fleeting sporting success, holding down a position in Ormond's First VIII rowing squad for a brief period. He continued to pursue his study of beetles in private, although his classmates found out and there was no loss in this as they viewed his hobby positively. Despite an ongoing shyness, Burnet got on well with staff and students at university. Burnet was self-motivated and often skipped lectures to study at his own faster pace and pursue further knowledge in the library, and he came equal first in physics and chemistry in first year. The following year, 1918, he became increasingly immersed in laboratory work, but he was also dogged by peer pressure to enlist in the , which he saw as a distasteful prospect. However, this was averted by the end of the . In 1919, he was one of 12 high-performing students selected for extra tuition, and he came equal first in third year physiology. He began clinical work in the same year, but found it somewhat unpleasant as he was interested in diagnosing the patient and had little interest in showing empathy towards them.\nWhile at university, he became an  and later an aggressive atheist; he was sceptical of religious faith, which he regarded as \"an effort to believe what common sense tells you isn't true.\" He was also disgusted by what he regarded as hypocritical conduct by religious adherents. Towards the later years of his undergraduate years, his unhappiness with religion began to dog him to a greater extent. He tried to become involved with  for a brief period but then resolved to devote himself to scientific research. The length of time required to study medicine had been reduced to five years to train doctors faster following the outbreak of , and Burnet graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and a Bachelor of Surgery in 1922, ranking second in the final exams despite the death of his father a few weeks earlier. His fellow graduates included , , , Rupert Willis and , who became distinguished scientists in their own right.\nHe then did a ten-month residency at  to gain experience before going into practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under  and , both well known surgeons. He enjoyed this period immensely and was disappointed when he had to do his medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist , whom Burnet came to idolise. As a result of this he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the  was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, who was in charge of such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more suited to a laboratory research career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. Burnet complied.\nDuring the transition period he worked as a pathology registrar at the  and also prepared for his Doctor of Medicine examinations, late in 1923. In 1923 he took up the post of senior resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital; the laboratories were a part of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He conducted research into the  reactions in , leading to his first scientific publications. He decided to work full-time on the  response in , even though he was technically supposed to pursuing  as part of his obligations to the hospital. Burnet came first in the Doctor of Medicine exams by a long distance, and his score was excluded from the scaling process so that the other students would not fail for being so far behind.\nAt the time, the Hall Institute was in the early stages of rapid expansion. The new director of the Institute, , wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in ,  and  that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to Burnet and saw him as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on  in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the  at the  in . Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was free to do his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if  was affected by .\nHe was awarded the  by the Lister Institute in 1926; this gave him enough money for him to resign his curator position and he began full-time research on bacteriophages. He injected mice with bacteriophage and observed their immunological reactions and believed bacteriophages to be . For this work he received a Ph.D. from the  in 1928 under the direction of Professor  and was invited to write a chapter on bacteriophages for the  . He was also given an invitation to deliver a paper at the  in 1927 on the link between O-agglutinins and bacteriophage. Burnet began attending the  functions and befriended some communists, although he refrained from joining them in overt left-wing activism. He also spent his free time enjoying theatre, engaging in amateur  and cycling through continental Europe.\nWhile in London, Burnet became engaged to fellow Australian Edith Linda Marston Druce. She was a secondary school teacher and daughter of a barrister's clerk and the pair had met in 1923 and had a few dates but did not keep in touch. Druce sought out Burnet while on a holiday in London and they quickly agreed to marriage although she had to return to Australia. They married in 1928 after he had completed his Ph.D. and returned to Australia, and had a son and two daughters. At the time, there was a vacancy for the Chair of Bacteriology at the University of London, and Ledingham was lobbying his colleagues to offer Burnet the post, but Burnet returned to Australia, partly because of Druce.\nWhen Burnet returned to Australia, he went back to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, where he was appointed assistant director by Kellaway. His first assignment was to investigate the \"Bundaberg disaster\", in which 12 children had died after receiving a contaminated  vaccine. Kellaway was put in charge of a  to investigate the matter and he put Burnet in charge of the laboratory investigations. He identified  in the toxin- mixture that had been administered to the children; it had been picked up from the skin of one of the children and then transmitted to the others in the injections. However, it turned out to be another toxin that had caused the children's deaths; this work on staphylococcal toxin piqued his interest in immunology. During this time, he continued to study bacteriophages, writing 32 papers on phages between 1924 and 1937. In 1929, Burnet and his graduate assistant Margot McKie wrote a paper suggesting that bacteriophages could exist as a stable non-infectious form that multiplies with the bacterial host. Their pioneering description of  was not accepted until much later, and was crucial to the work of ,  and  on the replication mechanism and genetics of viruses, for which they were awarded the 1969 .\nBetween 1932 and 1933, Burnet took leave of absence to undertake a fellowship at the  in London. The Great Depression had resulted in Burnet's salary being cut from 1000 to 750 pounds, and the National Institute had been given a large grant from the  that allowed them to hire Burnet at 1000 pounds per annum. The National Institute's Director Sir  gained permission from Kellaway for the two-year move; Kellaway promised to hold Burnet's job for him when he returned and felt that the experience would make Burnet\u2014whom he saw as the Hall Institute's brightest young scientist\u2014better equipped to expand operations when he returned to Melbourne. Dale also paid for Burnet's sister to travel to England to help look after her brother's young children.\nSignificant breakthroughs in virology were made while he was there, including the isolation and first demonstration of the transmission of the  virus. His own research was on the , which he used in developing a chick embryo assay for the isolation and quantification of animal viruses. Dale offered Burnet a permanent position but he declined and returned to the Hall Institute. Following his productive work in London, the Rockefeller Institute agreed to fund a new virus research laboratory in Melbourne for Burnet. He brought back a set of viruses from the National Institute to begin the basis of research in Melbourne.\nWhen Burnet returned to Australia, he continued his work on virology, including the  of . He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of  and . After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban in order to prevent human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist , the causative organism of which was named  in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of herpes and Q fever displayed an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his scientific method.\nDuring World War II, Burnet's research moved to  and . With the outbreak of war, Burnet was handed more responsibility and made acting director and had to oversee the move into a new building as Kellaway was seconded to the military in 1939. Due to Kellaway, many of the infectious disease problems afflicting the military were referred to the Institute. Fearing a repeat of the massive global influenza outbreak that occurred after World War I, Burnet focused the Institute in the search for a vaccine. He first tested the vaccine on a group of medical students, and after a promising test on 107 army volunteers in February 1942 following a rise in infections, a large-scale program was introduced two months later to inoculate all new recruits after an influenza A outbreak. In this trial, 20,000 personnel were vaccinated, without success, and the scheme was abandoned. In 1942, the investigations into scrub typhus accelerated after an exodus of researchers in that field from  after the  conquest of the area. However, this ended in tragedy when his collaborator  accidentally injected herself and then died of the infection. Nevertheless, his work on immunisation had earned him international recognition by this time.\nBurnet's first book, , was published in 1940. It had wide influence and was translated into several languages. In 1942 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1944 he travelled to  to deliver the Dunham Lectures. There he was offered a chair, but he refused and returned to Australia. This was attributed to his nationalistic tendencies, as well as his sense of loyalty to the Hall Institute. During his trip he also visited the US military facility at , where he discussed his work on influenza with the scientists working there.\nIn 1944, he was appointed director of the Institute when Kellaway was appointed director of the . Although Kellaway had groomed Burnet to become a pivotal figure, he was hesitant as to whether Burnet would be at his most effective with a strategic leadership role. Kellaway thought that Burnet might not be suited to the post, and should have continued to focus purely on research for the time being. Burnet had similar doubts, particularly given his taciturn nature, but applied for the position anyway. Although he was not known for his social skills, his ability as a scientist and to impart ideas for investigation to his subordinates held his leadership and the Institute in good stead. Unlike his predecessor, who valued a broad gamut of research activities, Burnet was of the opinion that the Institute could not make a significant impact at global level in this way, and he pursued a policy of focusing all effort into one area at a time. Always a strong-willed and rather isolated man, he became more single-minded and less tolerant of criticism of his work and expected a more hierarchical structure and unquestioning obedience. According to biographer Sexton, he \"displayed a kind of territorial protectiveness in relation to his own work\".\nIn 1944, it was decided by the University of Melbourne that Burnet would be appointed a professor as part of a cooperative program so that university students could be experimentally trained at the Institute, while the researchers engaged in some teaching. This was not a success, and there was much tension, as Burnet repeatedly expressed his opinion in public that university teaching and research should be kept separate, at one point leading to a series of open letters from university professors decrying his attitude. Burnet was also not interested in the politics of university funding, and his disengagement from administrative matters engendered resentment. On the other hand, Burnet was vigorous in obtaining funding for the Hall Institute from government bodies, resorting to the bluff of feigning interest in moving overseas to secure continued strong backing. However, he was criticised for being thrifty and refusing to invest in cutting edge equipment, despite the Hall Institute's high standing in research circles. Colleagues believed that he was sceptical of modern technology and thought his outlook to be limiting.\nIn 1946, he initiated the Clinical Research Unit to allow for closer cooperation with the clinical activities of the now named . Despite his known derisive views of clinical science as being inferior, he supported the work enthusiastically.\nUnder Burnet's direction, scientists at the Institute made significant contributions to infectious disease research during a period that has been called the \"golden age of virology\". Virologists including , , , , and  made significant contributions on , , , , herpes and influenza.\nBurnet made significant contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including  assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the  that is secreted by , which later provided the foundation for  significant work on  and the neuraminidase substrate, . Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.\nIn 1957, Burnet decided that research at the Institute should focus on immunology. Burnet reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned and feeling the action was arrogant; for Burnet's part he was comfortable with the decision as he thought it to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the 's . After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on immunological problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to  and the  reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of immunology, immunological surveillance and cancer.\nAt the time, immunology was becoming more sophisticated, with the increasing role of  and . Burnet was suspicious of the direction in which immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude was a factor in his decision to turn the Institute's focus to immunology.\nBurnet began to switch his focus to immunology in the 1940s. In 1941 he wrote a  called \"The Production of Antibodies\", which was revised and reissued in 1949 with Frank Fenner as a co-author. This book is seen as a key publication in immunology\u2014it marks the move from the study of immunology as a chemical endeavour to a biological one. Importantly in this work, he introduced the concept of \"self\" and \"non-self\" to immunology. The distinction between self and non-self was an integral part of Burnet's biological outlook, of his interest in the living organism in its totality, its activities, and interactions. Burnet regarded the \"self\" of the host body as being actively defined during its embryogenesis through complex interactions between immune cells and all the other cells and molecules within an embryo.\nUsing the concept of self, Burnet introduced a hypothesis about the situation where the body failed to make antibodies to its own components () and by extension the idea of . He proposed that\nBurnet was, however, unable to prove this experimentally. ,  and  did find support for Burnet's hypothesis in 1953 when they showed that  could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not from any other mouse strain. Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet and Medawar were able to coordinate their work effectively despite their rather different personalities and physical separation; Burnet was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.\nHowever, later studies showed that cells or tissues transplanted before the immune system development of the recipient, such as in embryonic recipients, could be treated as foreign and trigger rejection, countering Burnet's explanation for self tolerance. In contrast to the Burnet hypothesis of a special tolerance-inducing period defined by the age of the animal,  proposed in 1959, that it is the age of the lymphocyte that defines whether an antigen that is encountered will induce tolerance, with immature lymphocytes being tolerance-sensitive. Lederberg's concept is now known as central tolerance, and is widely accepted. It may also explain the success of some transplants given early in life and the failure to induce tolerance in other studies. Burnet noted that his contributions to immune tolerance were strictly theoretical:\nBurnet was interested in how the body produces antibodies in response to antigens. The dominant idea in the literature through the 1940s was that the antigen acted as a template for antibody production, which was known as the \"instructive\" hypothesis. Burnet was not satisfied with this explanation, and in the second edition of \"The Production of Antibodies\", he and Fenner advanced an indirect template theory which proposed that each antigen could influence the genome, thus effecting the production of antibodies. In 1956 he became interested in 's natural selection hypothesis, which described a mechanism for immune response based on an earlier theory of Nobel-winning immunologist . Jerne proposed that the antigen bound to an antibody by chance and, that upon binding, more antibodies to that antigen would be produced. Burnet developed a model which he named  that expanded on and improved Jerne's hypothesis. Burnet proposed that each  bears on its surface specific immunoglobulins reflecting the specificity of the antibody that will later be synthesised once the cell is activated by an antigen. The antigen serves as a selective stimulus, causing preferential proliferation and differentiation of\nthe clones that have receptors for that antigen.\nIn 1958  and Lederberg showed that one  always produces only one antibody, which was the first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book . His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and  as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.\nThere is some contention over Burnet's publication of his version of the theory in the  in 1957. Some commentators argue he published in an Australian journal to fast-track his hypothesis and obtain priority for his theory over ideas that were published later that year in a paper written by , which Burnet had read prior to its publication. In his paper Burnet cited Talmage's review, and in a later interview, Talmage said he believed that Burnet \"truthfully had developed the idea before he received my paper\". The theory is now sometimes known as Burnet's clonal selection theory, which overlooks the contributions of Ehrlich, Jerne, Talmage, and the contributions of Lederberg, who conceptualised the genetics of clonal selection.\nBurnet's work on graft-versus-host was in collaboration with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this was known as the Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain  in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune . They looked at the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug  to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human autoimmune disease.\nIn 1960, Burnet scaled back his laboratory work, taking one day off per week to concentrate on writing. In 1963, , which he authored with , was published. He also oversaw an expansion of the Hall Institute and secured funding from the  and the state government to build two further floors in the building and take over some of the space taken up by the pathology department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Despite this, Burnet believed that a world class research body needed to be small enough that one person could effectively run it, and maintained tight control over its activities throughout his leadership. He determined the policies himself, and personally selected all of the research staff and students, relying on a small staff to enforce his plans.\nHe continued to be active in the laboratory until his retirement in 1965, although his experimental time began to decrease as the operations became increasingly focused on immunology; Burnet's work in this area had been mostly theoretical. Gustav Nossal became the next director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. Under Burnet's leadership the Institute had become \"probably the world's best known research centre devoted to the study of immunology.\" However, with the increasing sophistication in medical science and its reliance on more complicated technology, Burnet's lone-wolf approach became less compatible with the research environment, which required more collaboration. In his final years at the helm, Burnet allowed more technical modernisation during the transition period to Nossal's leadership.\nFrom 1937 Burnet was involved in a variety of scientific and public policy bodies, starting with a position on a government advisory council on polio. After he became the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1944, he was considered a public figure and overcame shyness to become a good public speaker. He recognised the importance of co-operation with the media if the general public was to understand science and scientists, and his writings and lectures played an important part in the formulation of public attitudes and policy in Australia on a variety of biological topics. However, despite making many appearances on radio and television, he never became at ease with interviews and had to be selective with outreach engagements due to the many invitations he received, and tended to accept those that had the potential to promote the Institute. Over time, he began to increase his activism, as he felt more confident that he would be able to make an impact as his reputation grew, especially after winning the Nobel Prize, and even more so after his retirement from the directorship of the Institute. Although Burnet was not naturally outgoing, he saw it as the social responsibility of a scientific leader and scholar to publicly speak out and impart wisdom and foresight to the wider community.\nBurnet served as a member or chairman of scientific committees, both in Australia and overseas. Between 1947 and 1953, he was a member of the 's Medical Research Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for medical research in Australia. During this same period (1947\u201352), he was also a member of the  Defence Research and Development Policy Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that Burnet made the recommendation that Australia pursue development of  and  to target neighbouring countries' food stocks and spread infectious diseases. His report was titled . Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; he was concerned that Australians were being exposed to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.\nInternationally, Burnet was a chairman of the Papua New Guinea Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1962 and 1969. At the time, Papua New Guinea was an Australian territory, and Burnet had first travelled there as his son was posted there. His role on the committee allowed him to explore his interest in . He was particularly interested in  (laughing sickness), and lobbied the Australian government to establish the Papua New Guinea Institute of Human Biology. Burnet later helped oversee the institute's contribution to the Anglo-Australian participation in the International Biological Programme in the Field of Human Adaptability.\nBurnet served as first chair for the  (1966\u201369), a Commonwealth initiative to foster interaction between the member countries' elite, and he was also active in the , serving on the Expert Advisory Panels on Virus Diseases and on Immunology between 1952 and 1969 and the World Health Organization Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1969 and 1973.\nIn 1964, he was appointed to sit on the University Council of Victoria's third university  on an interim basis until the institution was formed in 1966. He served until 1970. He advocated a less hierarchical relationship between a professor and student, something seen as a move away from the English tradition prevalent in Australia towards an American model. He also called for the downgrading of the importance placed on the liberal arts. His ideas were too radical for his peers and he stepped down from the role in 1970 after none of his suggestions had made an impact.\nBurnet was opposed to the use of nuclear power in Australia owing to the issues of . He later retracted his objections to , feeling that nuclear power was necessary while other renewable energy sources were being developed. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he was also vocal in the anti-smoking movement; he was one of the first high-profile figures in Australia to educate the public on the dangers of tobacco, and he appeared in a television advertisement criticising the ethics of , and broadcasters for displaying such material. He and fellow activists were surprised that the commercial was allowed to run briefly, before being taken off air by the station, which only further generated attention for the anti-smoking campaign. A former smoker, he had rejected the habit in the 1950s after several friends died. Burnet was also a critic of the  and called for the creation of an international police force.\nFollowing his resignation from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an office at the  in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books on a variety of topics including immunology, ageing and cancer, and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled , which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He was known for his ability to write quickly, often without a final draft, and his ability to convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had much influence. In 1969 he published , considered his magnum opus on immunity, which attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the clonal selection theory. The following year, he wrote , which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused work schedule, often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.\nHe became president of the  in 1965, having been a foundational fellow when the Academy was formed in 1954. He had been offered the presidency in 1958 to replace the inaugural head Sir , but declined, although he served on the council and as vice president in 1961\u201363. As president he was recognised by both government and the public as the leading scientist in Australia. His stature as a scientist gave him the gravitas to end policy disputes, and gave the Academy and its advocacy more credibility in the eyes of government and industry. As such his term was considered to be highly successful. Oliphant said that Burnet's personal prestige was very important in the increased respect the AAS won and that he \"made the biological sciences far more acceptable in Australia\".\nHe helped establish the Academy's Science and Industry Forum, which was formed in the second year of his leadership in order to improve dialogue between researchers and industrialists. It investigated whether a national science policy should be formulated and led to the eventual creation of the . He also laid the foundations of the . When his presidency ended in 1969, the Academy founded the , which is the Academy's highest award for biological sciences.\nAs in many of his previous pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group of the scientific community and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful due to a lack of concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members\u2014such as Burnet\u2014being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.\nIn 1966, Burnet accepted a nomination from Australia Prime Minister Sir  to become the inaugural chairman of the , a body that aimed to increase the professional interchange between the various nations of the . Burnet served in the role for three years and helped start it on a path of steady growth, although he was unable to use it as a personal platform to  espouse the importance of human biology.\nBurnet's essays and books published in his later life caused contention within the scientific community and to the chagrin of his peers Burnet often made pessimistic proclamations about the future of science. In 1966 Burnet wrote an opinion article for  entitled \"Men or Molecules?\" in which he questioned the usefulness of , arguing that it had not and would not contribute anything of use to medicine and that manipulation of the genome as had been demonstrated in bacteria would do more harm to humans than good. Gustav Nossal subsequently described Burnet as \"a biologist with a love-hate affair with biochemistry, which led to a brief but damaging rejection of the worth of molecular biology.\"\nHe delivered the inaugural Oscar Mendelsohn lecture in 1971 at  and advocated policies for Australia such as population control, prevention of war, long-term plans for the management of the environment and natural resources, Aboriginal land rights, socialism, recycling, advertising bans on socially harmful products, and more regulation of the environment. He angrily denounced French nuclear testing in the Pacific, and after consistently voting for the ruling Liberal Party coalition as it ruled for the past few decades, signed an open letter backing the opposition Labor Party of , which took power in 1972. However, he soon spoke out against Whitlam's lack of action against tobacco advertising and French nuclear tests. Burnet often found himself frustrated with the refusal of politicians to base policy on long-term objectives, such as the sustainability of human life.\nIn 1971\u201372, he wrote four books, most notably, , which caused great controversy due to its strident attacks on molecular biology, cellular biology, and claims that cancer and various other diseases were incurable and that it was pointless to try to do so. He also predicted that scientific progress would end soon.\nBurnet spoke and wrote widely on the topic of human biology after his retirement, aiming to reach all strata of society. He courted the media as well as the scientific community, often leading to sensationalist or scientifically unrigorous report of his outspoken views. This often angered colleagues, who viewed him as abusing his stature to deliberately cause a stir.  In 1966 Burnet presented the , focusing on human biology. He provided a conceptual framework for sustainable development; 21 years later the definition provided by the  was almost identical. In 1970 he revised an earlier book which was published as ; it was followed by , which was published in 1978. The books discuss aspects of human biology, a topic which Burnet wrote on extensively in his later years. In  he argued that the roots of all human behaviour can be found in the behaviour of animals; in  he addressed issues of ageing, life, death and the future of mankind. The books strongly polarised the scientific community, and one reviewer described his ideas of sociobiology as \"extreme\" and giving \"a dismal, unappealing view of humanity\". In , he also called for society to accept euthanasia of ill older people, repeat violent criminals, and most controversially, abortion of pregnancies likely to result in disabled children, and infanticide of handicapped newborns. Knowing that there would be a strong backlash for such policies, he departed overseas for a two-month lecture series at the time of the book launch. In his absence, he was strongly assailed in newspaper letters and some correspondents compared his stance on infanticide to that of . At the same time, he also changed his stance on nuclear power and advocated its use, and the reinvestment of revenue for research into solar power. This about face angered the environmental movement.\nHis first wife, Edith Linda Druce, died from lymphoid leukaemia in 1973, after a four-year struggle. During her final years, Burnet refused all offers of lectures overseas to spend more time nursing his ailing wife. For a period after this he became very lethargic and reclusive, numbed by his wife's death. He then moved into Ormond College for company, and resumed beetle collecting, but for a year after her death, Burnet tried to alleviate his grief by writing mock letters to her once a week. Gradually he regained his enthusiasm and began writing again. In 1975, he travelled to California to deliver a series of lectures. In 1976 he married Hazel G. Jenkins, a widowed former singer from a business family in her 70s who was working in the microbiology department as a librarian, and moved out of Ormond College.\nIn 1978 Burnet decided to officially retire; in retirement he wrote two books. During this time, he missed his laboratory work, and he was constrained to social events and theorising. In 1982, Burnet was one of three contributors to , writing about genetic issues and their impact on the nation's impact. As a result of the success of the book, in early 1983, Burnet was appointed to the 70-person Australian Advisory Council of Elders to offer counsel to policymakers, but the group folded after several members became too frail or died.\nBurnet continued to travel and speak, but in the early 1980s, he and his wife became increasingly hampered by illness. Having surmised his illness two years earlier, in November 1984 he underwent surgery for . He made plans to resume scientific meetings, but was then taken ill again, with significant pain in his thorax and legs. Secondary lesions were found in June 1985 and declared to be inoperable and terminal. A supporter of euthanasia, Burnet was unfazed by his imminent death, and he died on 31 August at his son's home at  after two months' of illness. He was given a state funeral by the government of Australia; many of his distinguished colleagues from the Hall Institute such as Nossal and Fenner were pall-bearers, and he was buried near his paternal grandparents after a private family service at  in Koroit, near Port Fairy. Following his death he was honoured by the ; Prime Minister  took the highly unusual step of moving a condolence motion, an honour typically reserved for parliamentarians. Lady Hazel Burnet died in 1990.\nBurnet received extensive honours for his contributions to science and public life during his lifetime. He was  in the , received the Elizabeth II Coronation Medal in 1953, and was appointed to the  (OM) in the 1958 . In 1960 he was the first recipient of the honorary  award. He received a Gold and Silver Star from the Japanese  in 1961.  He was appointed  (KBE) in the , and received the Elizabeth II Jubilee Medal in 1977. In 1978 he was made a  (AK). He was only the fourth person to receive this honour.\nHe was a fellow or honorary member of 30 international Academies of Sciences. He received 10 honorary  degrees from universities including Cambridge, Harvard and Oxford, an honorary  degree from Hahnemann Medical College (now part of ), an honorary Doctor of Medical Science from the  and a  degree from the University of Melbourne. Including his Nobel, he received 19 medals or awards including the  and the  from the Royal Society and the ; he also received 33 international lectureships and 17 lectureships within Australia.\nAfter his death, Australia's largest communicable diseases research institute\u2014the  was renamed in his honour. The Burnet Clinical Research Unit of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute was also named in his honour in 1986. In 1975 his work on immunology was recognised by a 33-cent stamp released by . Seven Australian medical scientists were commemorated in the issue of a set of four Australian stamps released in 1995; he appears on the 45-cent stamp with fellow University of Melbourne graduate . He also appears on a  stamp that was issued in 1997. The centenary of his birth was celebrated in Australia in 1999; a statue of him was erected in Franklin Street, Traralgon; and several events were held in his honour including the release of a new edition of  by Oxford University Press.\nBurnet biographer Christopher Sexton suggests that Burnet's legacy is fourfold: (1) the scope and quality of his research; (2) his nationalistic attitude which led him to stay in Australia, leading to the development of science in Australia and inspiring future generations of Australian scientists; (3) his success establishing the reputation of Australian medical research worldwide; and (4) his books, essays and other writings. In spite of his sometimes controversial ideas on science and humanity,  has noted that \"Burnet's reputation is secure in his achievements as an experimentalist, a theoretician and a leader of the Australian scientific community.\"\n\n\n"},

He shared the prize with  and .\nEccles was born in , Australia. He grew up there with his two sisters and his parents: William and Mary Carew Eccles (both teachers, who  him until he was 12). He initially attended Warrnambool High School (now ) (where a science wing is named in his honour), then completed his final year of schooling at . Aged 17, he was awarded a senior scholarship to study medicine at the . As a medical undergraduate, he was never able to find a satisfactory explanation for the interaction of mind and body; he started to think about becoming a neuroscientist. He graduated (with first class honours) in 1925, and was awarded a  to study under  at , , where he received his Doctor of Philosophy in 1929.\nIn 1937 Eccles returned to Australia, where he worked on military research during . During this time Eccles was the director of Kanematsu Institute at , he and  gave research lectures at the , strongly influencing its intellectual environment. After the war, he became a professor at the  in New Zealand. From 1952 to 1962 he worked as a professor at the  (JCSMR) of the . The Eccles Institute of Neuroscience is headquartered in a new wing of the JCSMR building, constructed with the assistance of a $63M grant from the Commonwealth Government and completed in March 2012.\nIn the early 1950s, Eccles and his colleagues performed the research that would lead to his receiving the Nobel Prize. To study synapses in the peripheral nervous system, Eccles and colleagues used the stretch reflex as a model, which is easily studied because it consists of only two : a sensory neuron (the  fibre) and the . The sensory neuron synapses onto the motor neuron in the . When a current is passed into the sensory neuron in the , the motor neuron innervating the quadriceps produced a small  (EPSP). When a similar current is passed through the , the opposing muscle to the quadriceps, an  (IPSP) is produced in the quadriceps motor neuron. Although a single EPSP was not enough to fire an  in the motor neuron, the sum of several EPSPs from multiple sensory neurons synapsing onto the motor neuron can cause the motor neuron to fire, thus contracting the quadriceps. On the other hand, IPSPs could subtract from this sum of EPSPs, preventing the motor neuron from firing.\nApart from these seminal experiments, Eccles was key to a number of important developments in . Until around 1949, Eccles believed that  was primarily electrical rather than chemical. Although he was wrong in this hypothesis, his arguments led him and others to perform some of the experiments which proved chemical synaptic transmission.  and Eccles worked together on some of the experiments which elucidated the role of  as a  in the brain.\nHe was appointed a  in 1958 in recognition of services to physiological research.\nHe won the  Award in 1963, the same year he won the Nobel Prize.\nIn 1964 he became an honorary member to the , and in 1966 he moved to the United States to work at the  in Chicago. Unhappy with the working conditions there, he left to become a professor at the  from 1968 until he retired in 1975. After retirement, he moved to Switzerland and wrote on the .\nIn 1981, Eccles became a founding member of the .\nIn 1990 he was appointed a  of the  (AC) in recognition of service to science, particularly in the field of neurophysiology. He died in 1997 in , , Switzerland.\nIn  (1973), Eccles summarises his philosophy: \"Now before discussing brain function in detail I will at the beginning give an account of my philosophical position on the so-called 'brain-mind problem' so that you will be able to relate the experimental evidence to this philosophical position. I have written at length on this philosophy in my book . In Fig. 6-1 you will be able to see that I fully accept the recent philosophical achievements of  with his concept of three worlds.

It takes care of everything that is in existence and in our experience. All can be classified in one or other of the categories enumerated under Worlds 1, 2 and 3.\n\n\"In Fig. 6-1, World 1 is the world of physical objects and states. It comprises the whole cosmos of matter and energy, all of biology including human brains, and all artifacts that man has made for coding information, as for example, the paper and ink of books or the material base of works of art. World 1 is the total world of the materialists. They recognise nothing else. All else is fantasy.\n\"World 2 is the world of states of consciousness and subjective knowledge of all kinds. The totality of our perceptions comes in this world. But there are several levels. In agreement with Polten, I tend to recognise three kinds of levels of World 2, as indicated in Fig. 6-2, but it may be more correct to think of it as a spectrum.\nFIG. 6-2, World of Consciousness\n\"The first level (outer sense) would be the ordinary perceptions provided by all our sense organs, hearing and touch and sight and smell and pain. All of these perceptions are in World 2, of course: vision with light and colour; sound with music and harmony; touch with all its qualities and vibration; the range of odours and tastes, and so on. These qualities do not exist in World 1, where correspondingly there are but electromagnetic waves, pressure waves in the atmosphere, material objects, and chemical substances.\n\"In addition there is a level of , which is the world of more subtle perceptions. It is the world of your emotions, of your feelings of joy and sadness and fear and anger and so on. It includes all your memory, and all your imaginings and planning into the future. In fact there is a whole range of levels which could be described at length. All the subtle experiences of the human person are in this inner sensory world. It is all private to you but you can reveal it in linguistic expression, and by gestures of all levels of subtlety.\n\"Finally, at the core of World 2 there is the  or , which is the basis of our unity as an experiencing being throughout our whole lifetime.\n\"This World 2 is our . Our conscious experiences are the basis of our knowledge of World 1, which is thus a world of , a derivative world. Whenever I am doing a scientific experiment, for example, I have to plan it cognitively, all in my thoughts, and then consciously carry out my plan of action in the experiment. Finally I have to look at the results and evaluate them in thought. For example, I have to see the traces of the oscilloscope and their photographic records or hear the signals on the loudspeaker. The various signals from the recording equipment have to be received by my sense organs, transmitted to my brain, and so to my consciousness, then appropriately measured and compared before I can begin to think about the significance of the experimental results. We are all the time, in every action we do, incessantly playing backwards and forwards between World 1 and World 2.\n\"And what is World 3? As shown in Fig. 6-1 it is the whole world of culture. It is the world that was created by man and that reciprocally made man. This is my message in which I follow Popper unreservedly. The whole of language is here. All our means of communication, all our intellectual efforts coded in books, coded in the artistic and technological treasures in the museums, coded in every artefact left by man from primitive times\u2014this is World 3 right up to the present time. It is the world of civilisation and culture. Education is the means whereby each human being is brought into relation with World 3. In this manner he becomes immersed in it throughout life, participating in the heritage of mankind and so becoming fully human. World 3 is the world that uniquely relates to man. It is the world which is completely unknown to animals. They are blind to all of World 3. I say that without any reservations. This is then the first part of my story.\n\"Now I come to consider the way in which the three worlds interact...\"\nDespite these words, in his late book , Eccles proposed a dualistic mechanism of mind.\nEccles had nine children. Eccles married Irene Miller Eccles (1904-2002) in 1928 and divorced in 1968. After his divorce in 1968, Eccles married Helena T\u00e1bor\u00edkov\u00e1; a fellow neuropsychologist and M.D. of Charles University. The two often collaborated in research and they remained married until his death. Eccles died on 2 May 1997 in his home of . He was buried in Contra, Switzerland.\n"},

His family returned to Sydney, Australia, when he was six months old. As a child he lived in a flat with his sister, a nanny, and a maid while his parents lived in an adjoining flat.  In 1916 they moved to a house in  that many years later became a nursing home, Lulworth House, the residents of which included , , and White's partner .\nAt the age of four, White developed asthma, a condition that had taken the life of his maternal grandfather. White's health was fragile throughout his childhood, which precluded his participation in many childhood activities.\nHe loved the theatre, which he first visited at an early age (his mother took him to see  at the age of six). This love was expressed at home when he performed private rites in the garden and danced for his mother's friends.\nAt the age of five, he attended kindergarten at Sandtoft in , in Sydney's .\nAt the age of ten, White was sent to , a boarding school in  in the  of New South Wales, in an attempt to abate his asthma. It took him some time to adjust to the presence of other children. At boarding school, he started to write plays. Even at this early age, White wrote about palpably adult themes. In 1924, the boarding school ran into financial trouble, and the headmaster suggested for White to be sent to a  in England, a suggestion that his parents accepted.\nWhite struggled to adjust to his new surroundings at , England. He later described it as \"a four-year prison sentence\". White withdrew socially and had a limited circle of acquaintances. Occasionally, he would holiday with his parents at European locations, but their relationship remained distant. However he did spend time with his cousin Jack Withycombe during this period, and Jack's daughter  became a mentor to him while he was writing his first book of poems,  between the years 1927\u201329.\nWhile at school in London, White made one close friend, Ronald Waterall, an older boy who shared similar interests. White's biographer, , wrote that \"the two men would walk, arm-in-arm, to London shows; and stand around stage doors crumbing for a glimpse of their favourite stars, giving a practical demonstration of a chorus girl's high kick... with appropriate vocal accompaniment\". When Waterall left school, White withdrew again. He asked his parents if he could leave school to become an actor. The parents compromised and allowed him to finish school early if he came home to Australia to try life on the land. His parents felt that he should work on the land rather than become a writer and hoped that his work as a  would temper his artistic ambitions.\nWhite spent two years working as a  at Bolaro, a 73-square-kilometre (28\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) station near , on the edge of the , in southeastern Australia. Although he grew to respect the land and his health improved, it was clear that he was not cut out for this life.\nFrom 1932 to 1935, White lived in England, studying French and German literature at , . During his time at Cambridge he developed a romantic attraction to a young man who had come to King's College to become an Anglican priest. White dared not speak of his feelings for fear of losing the friendship and, like many other gay men of that period, he feared that his sexuality would doom him to a lonely life. Then, one night, the student priest, after an awkward liaison with two women, admitted to White that women meant nothing to him sexually. That became White's first love affair.\nDuring White's time at Cambridge he published a collection of poetry entitled , and wrote a play named , which was later performed by an amateur group (which included his sister Suzanne) at the tiny  in Sydney. After being admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1935, White briefly settled in London, where he lived in an area that was frequented by artists. There, the young author thrived creatively for a time, writing several unpublished works and reworking , a novel that he had written while jackarooing. In 1937, White's father died, leaving him ten thousand pounds in inheritance. The fortune enabled him to write full-time in relative comfort. Two more plays followed before he succeeded in finding a publisher for . The novel was received well in London but poorly in Australia. He began writing another novel, , but abandoned it before its completion after receiving negative comments, a decision that he later admitted regretting.\nIn 1936, White met the painter , 18 years his senior, who became an important influence in his life and work. The two men never became lovers but remained firm friends. In White's own words, \"He became what I most needed, an intellectual and aesthetic mentor\". They had many similarities: they were both gay and they both felt like outsiders in their own families; as a result they both had ambivalent feelings about their families and backgrounds, yet both maintained close and lifelong links with their families, particularly their mothers. They also both appreciated the benefits of social standing and connections and Christian symbolism and biblical themes are common in both artists' work.\nWhite dedicated his first novel  to De Maistre and acknowledged De Maistre's influence on his writing. In 1947, De Maistre's painting  was used as the cover for the first edition of White's . White bought many of De Maistre's paintings. In 1974 White gave all his paintings by De Maistre to the .\nTowards the end of the 1930s, White spent time in the United States, including , Massachusetts, and , which were artistic hotbeds at the time, where he wrote . By the time World War II broke out, he had returned to London and joined the British . He was accepted as an intelligence officer, and was posted to the Middle East. He served in Egypt, Palestine, and Greece before the war was over. While in the Middle East, he had an affair with a Greek army officer, , who was to become his life partner.\nWhite and Lascaris lived together in Cairo for six years before moving to a small farm purchased by White at , near Sydney, in 1948. After the death of White's mother in 1963, they moved into a large house, , in , where they lived for the rest of their lives.\nAfter the war, White once again returned to Australia, buying an old house in , now a Sydney suburb but then semi-rural. He named the house \"The Dogwoods,\" after trees he planted there. In this house, he settled down with Lascaris, the Greek he had met during the war. They lived there for 18 years, selling flowers, vegetables, milk, and cream as well as pedigreed puppies. During these years he started to make a reputation for himself as a writer, publishing  and  in the United States in 1955 and shortly after in the United Kingdom.  was released to rave reviews in the United States, but in what had become a typical pattern, it was panned in Australia. White had doubts about whether to continue writing after his books were largely dismissed in Australia (three of them having been called 'un-Australian' by critics), but, in the end, he decided to persevere. His first breakthrough in Australia came when his next novel, , won the inaugural .\nIn 1961, White published . It was to become both a bestseller and a prizewinner, gaining him a second Miles Franklin Award. In 1963, White and Lascaris decided to sell the house at Castle Hill. A number of White's works from the 1960s depict the fictional town of Sarsaparilla, including his collection of short stories, , and the play, . By now, he had clearly established his reputation as one of the world's great authors, but remained an essentially private person, resisting opportunities for interviews and public appearances although his circle of friends had widened significantly.\nIn 1968, White wrote , a searing character portrait of an artist. Many people drew links to the Sydney painter  (1904\u201384) and White's friend, the painter , but White denied the connections. Patrick White was an art collector who had, as a young man, been deeply impressed by his friends  and , and later said he wished he had been an artist.  By the mid-1960s, he had also become interested in encouraging dozens of young and less established artists, such as , , and . White was later friends with , the young star of Australian painting, in the 1970s. That friendship ended when White felt that Whiteley, a heroin addict, was deceitful and pushy about selling his paintings. A portrait of White by  won the 1962 .\nWhite decided not to accept any more prizes for his work, and he declined both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by  to work on a screenplay for  but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia's decision to participate in the . His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the , but in 1971, after losing to , he wrote to a friend: .\nNevertheless, in 1973, White did accept the Nobel Prize \"for an epic and psychological narrative art, which has introduced a new continent into literature\". His cause was said to have been championed by a Scandinavian diplomat resident in Australia. White enlisted Nolan to travel to Stockholm to accept the prize on his behalf. The award had an immediate impact on his career, as his publisher doubled the print run for  and gave him a larger advance for his next novel. White used the money from the prize to establish a trust to fund the , given annually to established creative writers who have received little public recognition. He was invited by the  to be seated on the floor of the House in recognition of his achievement. White declined, explaining that his nature could not easily adapt itself to such a situation. The last time such an invitation had been extended was in 1928, to .\nWhite was made  for 1974, but in a typically rebellious fashion, his acceptance speech encouraged Australians to spend the day reflecting on the state of the country. Privately, he was less than enthusiastic about it. In a letter to Marshall Best on 27 January 1974, he wrote: \"Something terrible happened to me last week. There is an organisation which chooses an Australian of the Year, who has to appear at an official lunch in  on . This year I was picked on as they had run through all the swimmers, tennis players, yachtsmen\".\nWhite and Lascaris hosted many dinner parties at Highbury, their Centennial Park home, in a leafy part of the affluent Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. In , his biographer  portrays White as a genial host but one who easily fell out with friends.\nWhite supported the conservative, business oriented  until the election of 's  government and, following the , he became particularly , making a rare appearance on national television to broadcast his views on the matter. White also publicly expressed his admiration for the historian , satirist , and unionist .\nDuring the 1970s, White's health began to deteriorate: his teeth were crumbling, his eyesight was failing, and he had chronic lung problems - however, he also became a more openly political person, and began sometimes commenting on current issues. He was among the first group of Companions of the  in 1975 but resigned in June 1976 in protest at the dismissal of the Whitlam government in November 1975 by the Governor-General Sir . In 1979, his novel  was shortlisted for the , but White requested that it to be removed to give younger writers a chance to win. (The prize was won by , who ironically was just four years younger than White.) Soon after, White announced that he had written his last novel, and from then on, he would write only for radio or the stage.\nDirector  introduced himself to White while walking down a Sydney street, some time after White had seen a politically loaded stage revue by Sharman, , which had been panned by Sydney newspaper critics, and had written a letter to the editor of a newspaper defending the show. White felt somewhat cautious at first, not least due to the gulf in age between them, but after a while the two men became friends and Sharman and his theatrical circle, as well as his visual style as a director, would inspire White to a couple of new plays, notably  with its satirical portrayal of a posh and vulgar upper-class Sydney society. A few years later, Sharman asked White if he could make a film of . White agreed and wrote the screenplay for the film.\nIn 1981, White published his autobiography, , which explored issues about which he had publicly said little such as his homosexuality, his dislike of the \"subservient\" attitude of Australian society towards Britain and the Royal family, and also the distance he had felt towards his mother. On , 1982, White addressed a crowd of 30,000 people, calling for a ban on  and for the destruction of .\nIn 1986 White released one last novel, , but it was published under the pen name \"Alex Xenophon Demirjian Gray\" with White named as editor.

White refused to see it when it was first performed at the , because  had been invited, and chose instead to see it later in Sydney. In 1987, White wrote , with his musings on ageing and society's efforts to achieve aesthetic perfection. When David Marr finished his biography of White in July 1990, his subject spent nine days going over the details with him.\nWhite died in Sydney on 30 September 1990.\nIn 2009, The Sydney Theatre Company staged White's play . In 2010 White received posthumous recognition for his novel , which was shortlisted for the  for 1970.\nIn 2011 Fred Schepisi's  of  was released with screenplay adaptation by ,  playing the son Basil,  as the daughter Dorothy, and  as the dying matriarch Elizabeth Hunter. This is the first screen realisation of a White novel, fittingly the one that played a key role in the Swedish panel's choice of White as Nobel prize winner.\nIn 1970, White was offered a knighthood but declined it.\nBoth White and  were members of the first group of six people appointed  (AC) in the civil division, (now called the general division). The awards were announced in the 1975 Queen's Birthday Honours List.

It has been claimed that the  theory was ridiculed by established scientists and doctors, who did not believe that any bacteria could live in the acidic environment of the stomach.

The first 30 out of 100 samples showed no support for their hypothesis. However, it was discovered that the lab technicians had been throwing out the cultures after 2 days. This was standard practice for throat swabs where other organisms in the mouth rendered cultures as not useful after 2 days. Due to other hospital work, the lab technicians did not have time to immediately throw out the 31st test on the second day, and so it stayed from Thursday through to the Monday. In this sample, they discovered the presence of H. pylori. It turns out that H. pylori grow more slowly than 2 days, and also that the stomach cultures are not contaminated by other organisms.\nIn 1983 they submitted their findings so far to the Gastroenterological Society of Australia, but the reviewers turned their paper down, rating it in the bottom 10% of those they received in 1983.\nAfter failed attempts to infect piglets in 1984, Marshall, after having a baseline  done, drank a broth containing cultured , expecting to develop, perhaps years later, an ulcer.

For this work, she was awarded the 2009 , sharing it with Greider and , becoming the first Australian woman Nobel laureate. She also worked in , and was controversially dismissed from the  Administration's .\n\nElizabeth Helen Blackburn, one of seven children, was born in , , on 26 November 1948 to parents who were both family physicians. Her family moved to the city of  when she was four, where she attended the Broadland House Church of England Girls' Grammar School (later amalgamated with ) until the age of sixteen. Upon her family's relocation to , she attended , and ultimately gained very high marks in the end-of-year final statewide matriculation exams. She went on to earn a  in 1970 and  in 1972, both from the  in the field of biochemistry. Blackburn then went to receive her  in 1975 from the , where she worked with Frederick Sanger developing methods to sequence DNA using RNA, as well as studying the bacteriophage . It was also here, the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge University, where Blackburn met her husband John Sedat. Blackburn's soon to be husband had taken a position at Yale, where she then decided to finish her postdoctoral. \u201cThus it was that love brought me to a most fortunate and influential choice: Joe Gall\u2019s lab at Yale.\u201d\nDuring her postdoctoral work at Yale, Blackburn was doing research on the protozoan  and noticed a repeating  at the end of the linear rDNA which varied in size Blackburn then noticed that this hexanucleotide at the end of the chromosome contained a TTAGGG sequence that was , and the terminal end of the chromosomes were palindromic. These characteristics allowed Blackburn and colleagues to conduct further research on the protozoan. Using the telomeric repeated end of , Blackburn and colleague Jack Szostak showed the unstable replicating plasmids of yeast were protected from degradation, proving that these sequences contained characteristics of telomeres. This research also proved the telomeric repeats of  were conserved evolutionarily between the species. Through this research, Blackburn and collaborators noticed the replication system for chromosomes was not likely to add to the lengthening of the telomere, and that the addition of these hexanucleotides to the chromosomes was likely due to the activity of an enzyme that is able to transfer specific functional groups. The proposition of a possible transferase-like enzyme led Blackburn and PhD student Carol W. Greider to the discovery of an enzyme with reverse transcriptase activity that was able to fill in the terminal ends of telomeres without leaving the chromosome incomplete and unable to divide without loss of the end of the chromosome. This 1985 discovery led to the purification of this enzyme in lab, showing the transferase-like enzyme contained both RNA and protein components. The RNA portion of the enzyme served as a template for adding the telomeric repeats to the incomplete telomere, and the protein added enzymatic function for the addition of these repeats.Through this breakthrough, the term \u201ctelomerase\u201d was given to the enzyme, solving the end-replication process that had troubled scientists at the time.\n works by adding base pairs to the overhang of DNA on the 3\u2019 end, extending the strand until DNA polymerase and an RNA primer can complete the complementary strand and successfully synthesize the double stranded DNA. Since DNA polymerase only synthesizes DNA in the leading strand direction, the shortening of the telomere results. Through their research, Blackburn and collaborators were able to show that the telomere is effectively replenished by the enzyme telomerase, which conserves cellular division by preventing the rapid loss of genetic information internal to the telomere, leading to cellular aging.\n\n\nOn January 1, 2016, Blackburn was interviewed about her studies, discovering telomerase, and her current research. When she was asked to recall the moment of telomerase discovery she stated:In 1978, Blackburn joined the faculty of the , in the Department of Molecular Biology. In 1990, she moved across the San Francisco Bay to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the  (UCSF), where she served as the Department Chair from 1993 to 1999 and was the Morris Herzstein Professor of Biology and Physiology at UCSF. Blackburn became a Professor Emeritus at UCSF at the end of 2015.\nBlackburn, co-founded the company Telomere Health which offers telomere length testing to the public, but later severed ties with the company.\nIn 2015, Elizabeth Blackburn was announced as the new President of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. \u201cFew scientists garner the kind of admiration and respect that Dr. Blackburn receives from her peers for her scientific accomplishments and her leadership, service and integrity,\u201d says Irwin M. Jacobs, chairman of Salk's Board of Trustees, on Blackburn's appointment as President of the Institute. \u201cHer deep insight as a scientist, her vision as a leader, and her warm personality will prove invaluable as she guides the Salk Institute on its continuing journey of discovery.\u201d \u00a0In 2017, she announced her plans to retire from the Salk Institute the following year.\nFor their research and contributions to the understanding of telomeres and the enzyme telomerase, Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider, and Jack Szostaks were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The substantial research on the effects of chromosomal protection from telomerase, and the impact this has on cellular division has been a revolutionary catalyst in the field of molecular biology. For example, the addition of telomerase to cells that do not possess this enzyme has shown to bypass the limit of cellular aging in those cells, thereby linking this enzyme to reduced cellular aging. The addition of telomerase, and the presence of the enzyme in cancer cells has been shown to provide an immunity mechanism for the cell in proliferating, linking the transferase activity to increased cellular growth and reduced sensitivity for cellular signalling. The importance of discovering this enzyme has since sent led her continued research at the University of California San Francisco, where she studies the effect of telomeres and telomerase activity on cellular aging.\nBlackburn was appointed a member of the  in 2002. She supported human embryonic cell research, in opposition to the Bush Administration. Her Council terms were terminated by  directive on 27 February 2004. Dr. Blackburn believes that she was dismissed from the Council due to her disapproval of the Bush administration's position against stem cell research. This was followed by expressions of outrage over her removal by many scientists, 170 of whom signed an open letter to the president maintaining that she was fired because of political opposition to her advice.\nScientists and ethicists at the time even went as far to say that Blackburn's removal was in violation of Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which \u201crequires balance on such advisory bodies\u201d\n\"There is a growing sense that scientific research\u2014which, after all, is defined by the quest for truth\u2014is being manipulated for political ends,\" wrote Blackburn. \"There is evidence that such manipulation is being achieved through the stacking of the membership of advisory bodies and through the delay and misrepresentation of their reports.\"\nBlackburn serves on the Science Advisory Board of the Regenerative Medicine Foundation formerly known as the Genetics Policy Institute.\nBlackburn's first book  (2017) was co-authored with  Dr. Elissa Epel of Aging, Metabolism, and Emotions (AME) Center at the UCSF Center for Health and Community. Blackburn comments on aging reversal and care for one's telomeres through lifestyle: managing chronic stress, exercising, eating better and getting enough sleep; telomere testing, plus cautions and advice. While studying telomeres and the replenishing enzyme, telomerase, Blackburn discovered a vital role played by these protective caps that revolved around one central idea: aging of cells. The book hones in on many of the effects that poor health can have on telomeres and telomerase activity. Since telomeres shorten with every division of a cell, replenishing these caps is essential to long term cell growth. Through research and data, Blackburn explained that people that lead stressful lives exhibit less telomerase functioning in the body, which leads to a decrease in the dividing capabilities of the cell. Once telomeres shorten drastically, the cells can no longer divide, meaning the tissues they replenish with every division would therefore die out, highlighting the aging mechanism in humans. To increase telomerase activity in people with stress-filled lives, Blackburn suggests moderate exercise, even 15 minutes a day, which has been proven to stimulate telomerase activity and replenish the telomere.\nBlackburn also states that unhappiness in lives also has an effect on the shortening of telomeres. In a study done on divorced couples, their telomere length was \"significantly shorter\" compared to couples in healthy relationships, and Blackburn states, \"There's an obvious stressor... we are intensely social beings.\" She suggests to include positivity into our daily lives to increase health as well. While increasing the amount of exercise, decreasing stress, tobacco use, and maintaining a balanced sleep schedule, Blackburn explains that our telomeres can be drastically maintained and prevented from rapid shortening, leading to a decrease in the aging process of our cells. Blackburn also tells the readers to be wary of clinical pills who proclaim to lengthen or telomeres and protect the body from aging. She says that these pills and creams have no scientific proof of being anti-aging supplements, and that the key to preserving our telomeres and stimulating telomerase activity comes from leading a healthy life.\nIn recent years Blackburn and her colleagues have been investigating the effect of stress on telomerase and telomeres with particular emphasis on  meditation. She is also one of several biologists (and one of two Nobel Prize laureates) in the 1995 science documentary . Studies suggest that chronic psychological stress may accelerate ageing at the cellular level. Intimate partner violence was found to shorten telomere length in formerly abused women versus never abused women, possibly causing poorer overall health and greater morbidity in abused women.\nAt the University of California San Francisco, Blackburn currently researches telomeres and telomerase in many organisms, from yeast to human cells. The lab is focused on telomere maintenance, and how this has an impact on cellular aging. Many chronic diseases have been associated with the improper maintenance of these telomeres, thereby effecting cellular division, cycling, and impaired growth. At the cutting edge of telomere research, the Blackburn lab currently investigates the impact of limited maintenance of telomeres in cells through altering the enzyme telomerase.\nBlackburns awards and honors include:\nBlackburn was elected:\nIn 2007, Blackburn was listed among 's \nBlackburn splits her time living between La Jolla and  with her husband, scientist John W. Sedat, whom she met while at Cambridge, and has a son, Benjamin.

He married the daughter of president . Saavedra Lamas achieved renown not only as foreign minister of Argentina for his practical work in drafting international agreements and in conducting international mediation, but also as a professor for his scholarship in the fields of labor legislation and international law.\nSaavedra Lamas was a distinguished student at Lacordaire College and at the  where he received the Doctor of Laws degree in 1903, . After study in Paris and travel abroad, he accepted a professorship in law and constitutional history at the , where he began the teaching career that was to span more than forty years. Later, he inaugurated a course in sociology at the University of Buenos Aires, taught political economy and constitutional law in the Law School of the university, and eventually served as the president of the university.\nSaavedra Lamas was a leading Argentine academician in two areas. A pioneer in the field of labor legislation, he edited several treatises on labor legislation in Argentina and on the need for a universally recognized doctrine on the treatment of labor - among them, Centro de legislac\u00edon social y del trabajo (1927) [Center of Social and Labor Legislation], Trait\u00e9s internationaux de type social (1924), C\u00f3digo nacional del trabajo (three volumes, 1933) [National Code of Labor Law]. In the arena of practical affairs, Saavedra Lamas drafted legislation affecting labor in Argentina, supported the founding of the International Labor Organization in 1919, and presided over the ILO Conference of 1928 in Geneva while serving simultaneously as leader of the Argentine delegation.\nIn international law, his other field of major scholarly interest, he published \"La Crise de la codification et de la doctrine Argentine de droit international\" (1931); and he spoke, wrote, or drafted legislation on many subjects with international ramifications - among them, asylum, colonization, immigration, arbitration, and international peace. His brief Vida internacional, which he wrote at the age of seventy, is an urbane by-product of all this study and experience.\nSaavedra Lamas began his political career in 1906 as director of Public Credit and then became the secretary-general for the municipality of Buenos Aires in 1907. In 1908 he was elected to the first of two successive terms in Parliament. There he initiated legislation regarding coastal water rights, irrigation, sugar production, government finances, colonization, and immigration. His main interest, however, lay in foreign affairs. He provided leadership in saving Argentina's arbitration treaty with Italy, which almost foundered in 1907-1908, and eventually became the unofficial adviser to both the legislature and the foreign office on the analysis and implications of proposed foreign treaties. Saavedra Lamas though was also a controversial public figure as he was seen by the masses as an elitist patrician who was too conservative and favored British intervention, especially in railroad construction.\nAppointed minister of Justice and Education in 1915, he instituted educational reforms by integrating the different divisions of public education and by developing a curriculum at the intermediate level for the vocational and technical training of manpower needed in a developing industrial country.\nWhen General  became president of Argentina in 1932, he appointed Saavedra Lamas as foreign minister. In this post for six years, Saavedra Lamas brought international prestige to Argentina. He played an important role in every South American diplomatic issue of the middle thirties, induced Argentina to rejoin the League of Nations after an absence of thirteen years, and represented Argentina at virtually every international meeting of consequence during this period.\nHis work in ending the  between Paraguay and Bolivia (1932\u20131935) had not only local significance but generalized international importance as well. When he took over the foreign office, he immediately engaged in a series of moves to lay the diplomatic groundwork for a negotiated settlement of this dispute. In 1932 he initiated at Washington the Declaration of August 3 which put the American states on record as refusing to recognize any territorial change in the hemisphere brought about by force. Next, he drew up a Treaty of Nonaggression and Conciliation which was signed by six South American countries in October, 1933, and by all of the American countries at the Seventh Pan-American Conference at Montevideo two months later. In 1935 he organized mediation by six neutral American nations which resulted in the cessation of hostilities between Paraguay and Bolivia. Meanwhile, in 1934, Saavedra Lamas presented the South American Antiwar Pact to the League of Nations where it was well received and signed by eleven countries. Acclaimed for all of these efforts, he was elected president of the Assembly of the League of Nations in 1936.\nAfter his retirement from the foreign ministry in 1938, Saavedra Lamas returned to academic life, became president of the University of Buenos Aires for two years (1941\u20131943), and rounded out his career as a professor for an additional three years (1943\u20131946).\nSaavedra Lamas was known as a strict disciplinarian in his office, a logician at the conference table, a charming host in his home or his art gallery, and a man of sartorial elegance who wore, it is said, the highest collars in Buenos Aires. In addition to the , he was awarded the  and analogous honors from ten other countries.\nHe died in 1959 at the age of eighty from the effects of a brain hemorrhage.\nIn March 2014 his solid gold Nobel medal was put up for auction after being found in a South American pawn shop.\nIn August 2014 a project for rebuying his Nobel medal by the Argentine Nation was presented at the Argentine congress.

After this he was also director of the , from 1957 on.\nHoussay's worked in many fields of physiology, such as the nervous, digestive, respiratory and circulatory systems, but his main contribution, which was recognized by the  in Physiology or Medicine of 1947, was on the experimental investigation of the role of the anterior hypophysis gland in the  of , particularly in . Houssay demonstrated in the 1930s the diabetogenic effect anterior hypophysis extracts and the decrease in diabetes severity with anterior hypophysectomy.

Although his laboratories were often plagued by lack of financial support and second-rate equipment, his research into sugar ,  metabolism, and   has garnered international attention and fame and has led to significant progress in understanding, diagnosing and treating the congenital disease . Luis Leloir is buried in , .\nLeloir's parents, Federico Augusto Rufino Leloir Bernal and Hortensia Aguirre de Leloir, traveled from Buenos Aires to Paris in the middle of 1906 with the intention of treating Federico's illness. However, Federico died in late August, and a week later Luis was born in an old house at 81 V\u00edctor Hugo Road in Paris, a few blocks away from the . After returning to Argentina in 1908, Leloir lived together with his eight siblings on their family's extensive property  that his grandparents had purchased after their immigration from the  of northern : El Tuy\u00fa comprises 400\u00a0km of sandy land along the coastline from  to  which has since become a popular tourist attraction.\nDuring his childhood, the future Nobel Prize winner found himself observing natural phenomena with particular interest; his schoolwork and readings highlighted the connections between the natural sciences and biology. His education was divided between Escuela General San Mart\u00edn (primary school),  (secondary school), and for a few months at  in . His grades were unspectacular, and his first stint in college ended quickly when he abandoned his architectural studies that he had begun in Paris' .\nIt was during the 1920s that Leloir invented  (golf sauce). After being served prawns with the usual sauce during lunch with a group of friends at the Ocean Club in Mar del Plata, Leloir came up with a peculiar combination of ketchup and mayonnaise to spice up his meal. With the financial difficulties that later plagued Leloir's laboratories and research, he would joke, \"If I had patented that sauce, we'd have a lot more money for research right now.\"\nAfter returning again to , Leloir obtained his Argentine citizenship and joined the Department of Medicine at the  in hopes of receiving his doctorate. However, he got off to a rocky start, requiring four attempts to pass his anatomy exam. He finally received his diploma in 1932 and began his residency in the  and his medical internship in Ramos Mej\u00eda hospital. After some initial conflicts with colleagues and complications in his method of treating patients, Leloir decided to dedicate himself to research in the laboratory, claiming that \"we could do little for our patients... antibiotics, psychoactive d, and all the new therapeutic agents were unknown [at the time].\"\nIn 1933, he met , who pointed Leloir towards investigating in his doctoral thesis the  and carbohydrate metabolism. Houssay happened to be friends with , the brother-in-law of , one of Leloir's cousins. Following the recommendation of Udaondo, Leloir began working with Houssay, who in 1947 would later win the . The two would develop a close relationship, collaborating on various projects until Houssay's death in 1971; in his lecture after winning the Nobel Prize, Leloir claimed that his \"whole research career has been influenced by one person, Prof. Bernardo A. Houssay\".\nAfter only two years, Leloir received recognition from the medical department at UBA for having produced the best doctoral thesis. Feeling that his knowledge in fields such as , , , and  was lacking, he continued attending classes at the University as a part-time student. In 1936 he traveled to England to begin advanced studies at the , under the supervision of another Nobel Prize winner, Sir , who had obtained that distinction in 1929 for his work in  and in revealing the critical role of  in maintaining good health. Leloir's research in the Biochemical Laboratory of Cambridge centered around , more specifically the effects of  and  on succinic dehydrogenase; from this moment Leloir began to specialize in researching carbohydrate metabolism.\nLeloir returned to Buenos Aires in 1937 after his brief stay at Cambridge. 1943 saw Leloir marry; Luis Leloir and Amelia Zuberbuhler (1920-2013) would later have a daughter also named Amelia. However, his return to Argentina was amidst conflict and strife;  Houssay had been expelled from the University of Buenos Aires for signing a public petition opposing the  regime in  and the military government led  by . Leloir fled to the , where he assumed the position of associate professor in the Department of  at , collaborating with  and  and thereafter worked with  at the College of Physicians and Surgeons,  as a research assistant. Leloir would later credit Green with instilling within him the initiative to establish his own research in Argentina.\nIn 1945, Leloir ended his exile and returned to Argentina to work under Houssay at the , which Leloir would direct from its creation in 1947 by businessman and patron . Initially, the institute was composed of five rooms, a bathroom, central hall, patio, kitchen, and changing room. During the final years of the 1940s, although lacking financial resources and operating with very low-cost teams, Leloir's successful experiments would reveal the chemical origins of sugar synthesis in  as well as the  of  in the liver; together with J. M. Mu\u00f1oz, he produced an active cell-free system, a first in scientific research. It had initially been assumed that in order to study a cell, scientists could not separate it from its host organism, as oxidation could only occur in intact cells. Along the way, Mu\u00f1oz and Leloir, unable to procure the costly centrifuge needed to separate cell contents, improvised by spinning a tire stuffed with salt and ice.\nBy 1947 he had formed a team that included \nCaputto, Enrico Cabib, Ra\u00fal Trucco, Alejandro Paladini, Carlos Cardini and Jos\u00e9 Luis Reissig, with whom he investigated and discovered why a malfunctioning kidney and  helped cause . That same year,  his colleague , in his investigations of the , made discoveries regarding carbohydrate storage and its subsequent transformation into a reserve energy form in organisms.\nAt the beginning of 1948, Leloir and his team identified the sugar nucleotides that were fundamental to the metabolism of carbohydrates, turning the Instituto Campomar into a biochemistry institution well known throughout the world. Immediately thereafter, Leloir received the Argentine Scientific Society Prize,  one of the many awards he would receive both in Argentina and internationally. During this time, his team dedicated itself to the study of ; Leloir and his colleagues elucidated the primary mechanisms of galactose metabolism (now coined the ) and determined the cause of galactosemia, a serious  that resulted in .\nThe following year, he reached an agreement with Rolando Garc\u00eda, dean of the  at UBA, which named Leloir, Carlos Eugenio Cardini and Enrico Cabib as titular professors in the University's newly founded Biochemical Institute. The Institute would help develop scientific programs in budding Argentine universities as well as attract researchers and scholars from the United States, , England, France, Spain, and other Latin American countries.\nFollowing Campomar's death in 1957, Leloir and his team applied to the  in the United States desperate for funding, and surprisingly was accepted. In 1958, the Institute found a new home in a former all-girls school, a donation from the Argentine government. As Leloir and his research gained greater prominence, further research came from the Argentine Research Council, and the Institute would later become associated with the University of Buenos Aires.\nAs his work in the laboratory was coming to an end, Leloir continued his teaching position in the Department of Natural Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires, taking a hiatus only to complete his studies at Cambridge and at the Enzyme Research Laboratory in the United States.\nIn 1983, Leloir became one of the founding members of the Third World Academy of Sciences, later renamed the .\nOn December 2, 1970, Leloir received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry from the King of  for his discovery of the  in , becoming only the third Argentine to receive the prestigious honor in any field. In his acceptance speech at , he borrowed from 's famous 1940 speech to the  and remarked, \"never have I received so much for so little\". Leloir and his team reportedly celebrated by drinking champagne from test tubes, a rare departure from the humility and frugality that characterized the atmosphere of Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Campomar under Leloir's direction. The $80,000 prize money was spent directly on research, and when asked about the significance of his achievement, Leloir responded:\nLeloir published a short autobiography, entitled \"Long Ago and Far Away\" in the 1983 . The title, Leloir claims, is derived from one of 's novels that depicted the country wildlife and scenery of Leloir's childhood.\nHe died in Buenos Aires December 2, 1987, of a heart attack soon after returning to his home from the laboratory, and is buried in . , a friend and colleague of Leloir, claims that his lasting legacy was proving that \"scientific research on an international level, although precarious, was possible in an underdeveloped country in the middle of political strife\" and credits Leloir's vigilance and will for his ultimate success. With his research in dire financial straits, Leloir often resorted to homemade gadgets and contraptions to continue his work in the laboratory. In one instance, Leloir reportedly used waterproof cardboard to create makeshift gutters in order to protect his laboratory's library from the rain.\nLeloir was known for his humility, focus and consistency, described by many as a \"true monk in science\". Every morning his wife Amelia would drive him in their  and drop him off at 1719 Juli\u00e1n Alvarez Street, location of Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Campomar, with Leloir wearing the same worn out, gray overalls. He worked sitting on the same straw seat for decades and encouraged colleagues to eat lunch in the laboratory to save time, bringing enough meat stew to share with everyone. Indeed, despite Leloir's frugality and extreme dedication to his research, he was a sociable man, claiming not to like working alone.\nThe Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Campomar has since been renamed , and has grown to become a 21,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (2,000\u00a0m) building with 20 senior researchers, 42 technicians and administrative personnel, 8 post doctorate fellows, and 20 Ph.D. candidates.

His parents were M\u00e1xima (Vapniarsky) and L\u00e1zaro Milstein, a  immigrant. He graduated from the  and obtained a PhD under Professor Stoppani (Professor of ). Thereafter, he was a member of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, England, and held dual Argentine and British citizenship. In 1956, he received an award from the Sociedad Bioqu\u00edmica Argentina for his work on  with the  aldehyde dehydrogenase. In 1958, funded by the , he joined the  Department at the  at  to work for a PhD under  on the mechanism of metal activation of the enzyme . During this work, he collaborated with  whose group he joined with a short-term  appointment.\nThe major part of Milstein's research career was devoted to studying the structure of antibodies and the mechanism by which antibody diversity is generated. It was as part of this quest that, in 1975, he worked with  (a postdoctoral fellow in his laboratory) to develop the  technique for the production of \u2014a discovery recognized by the award of the 1984 . This discovery led to an enormous expansion in the exploitation of antibodies in science and medicine.\nMilstein himself made many major contributions to improvements and developments in monoclonal antibody technology\u2014especially in the use of  to provide markers that allow distinction between different cell types. In collaboration with Claudio Cuello, Milstein helped lay the foundation for the use of monoclonal antibodies as probes for the investigation of the pathological pathways in neurological disorders as well as many other diseases. Milstein and Cuello's work also enabled the use of monoclonal antibodies to enhance the power of immuno-based diagnostic tests. In addition, Milstein foresaw the potential wealth of ligand-binding reagents that could result from applying recombinant  technology to monoclonal antibodies and inspired the development of the field of antibody engineering which was to lead to safer and more powerful monoclonal antibodies for use as therapeutics.\nMilstein's early work on antibodies focused on their diversity at the amino acid level, as well as on the disulfide bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies, where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted  that contained a signal sequence. The development of the  technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of  of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody . In this process, localized mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved , which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in recent years was devoted to characterizing this mutational process, with a view to understanding its mechanism. He contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.\nQuite apart from his own achievements, Milstein acted as a guide and inspiration to many in the antibody field, as well as devoting himself to assisting science and scientists in less developed countries. It is also worth mentioning, that even though the Nobel Prize would have made him a wealthy man, Milstein did not patent his enormous discovery since he believed that it was mankind's intellectual property. According to his beliefs, his work did not have any economic interest, only scientific.\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize 1984, Milstein was elected a , was a fellow of  from 1980 to 2002, awarded the  from  in 1980, won the  in 1989, and became a  in 1995.

He was joint recipient (with his father, ) of the  in 1915, \"For their services in the analysis of  by means of \"; an important step in the development of X-ray crystallography.\nBragg was  in 1941. As of 2020, he is the youngest ever  in physics, having received the award at the age of 25 years (youngest ever Nobel winner in any field is , who received Nobel Peace prize in 2014 at the age of 17). Bragg was the director of the , Cambridge, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was reported by  and  in February 1953.\nBragg was born in , South Australia to  (1862\u20131942),  Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the , and Gwendoline (1869\u20131929), daughter of , government astronomer of South Australia.\nHe showed an early interest in science and mathematics. Shortly after starting school he fell from his tricycle and broke his arm. His father, who had read about 's experiments in Europe and was performing his own experiments, used the newly discovered X-rays and his experimental equipment to examine the broken arm. This is the first recorded surgical use of X-rays in Australia.\nIn 1900, Bragg was a student at , followed by five years at . He went to the University of Adelaide at the age of 16 to study mathematics, chemistry and physics, graduating in 1908. In the same year his father accepted the Cavendish chair of physics at the , and brought the family to England. Bragg entered  in the autumn of 1909 and received a major scholarship in mathematics, despite taking the exam while in bed with . After initially excelling in mathematics, he transferred to the physics course in the later years of his studies, and graduated with first class honours in 1911. In 1914 Bragg was elected to a Fellowship at Trinity College \u2013 a Fellowship at a Cambridge college involves the submission and defence of a thesis.\nAmong Bragg's other interests was ; his personal collection amounted to specimens from some 500 species; all personally collected from South Australia. He discovered a new species of  \u2013 , named for him by .\nThe composition of X-rays was unknown, his father argued that X-rays are streams of particles, others argued that they are waves.  directed an X-ray beam at a crystal in front of a photographic plate; alongside of the spot where the beam struck there were additional spots from deflected rays \u2013 hence X-rays are waves. In 1912, as a first-year research student at Cambridge, W. L. Bragg, while strolling by the river, had the insight that crystals made from parallel sheets of atoms would not diffract X-ray beams that struck their surface at most angles because X-rays deflected by collisions with atoms would be out of phase, cancelling one another out. However, when the X-ray beam stuck at an angle at which the distances it passed between atomic sheets in the crystal equalled the X-ray's wavelength then those deflected would be in phase and produce a spot on a nearby film. From this insight he wrote the simple  that relates the wavelength of the X-ray and the distance between atomic sheets in a simple crystal to the angles at which an impinging X-ray beam would be reflected.\nHis father built an  in which a crystal could be rotated to precise angles while measuring the energy of reflections. This enabled father and son to measure the distances between the atomic sheets in a number of simple crystals. They calculated the spacing of the atoms from the weight of the crystal and the , which enabled them to measure the wavelengths of the X-rays produced by different metallic targets in the X-ray tubes. W. H. Bragg reported their results at meetings and in a paper, giving credit to \"his son\" (unnamed) for the equation, but not as a co-author, which gave his son \"some heartaches\", .\nBragg was commissioned early in  in the  as a  of the . In 1915 he was seconded to the  to develop a method to localise enemy artillery from the boom of their firing. On 2 September 1915 his brother was killed during the . Shortly afterwards, he and his father were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. He was 25 years old and remains the youngest science laureate. The problem with  was that the heavy guns boomed at too low a frequency to be detected by a microphone. After months of frustrating failure he and his group devised a hot wire air wave detector that solved the problem. In this work he was aided by , ,  and Henry Harold Hemming. British sound ranging was very effective; there was a unit in every British Army and their system was adopted by the Americans when they entered the war. For his work during the war he was awarded the  and appointed . He was also  on 16 June 1916, 4 January 1917 and 7 July 1919.\nHot wire sound ranging was used in  during which he served as a civilian adviser.\nBetween the wars, from 1919 to 1937, he worked at the  as  of Physics. He became the director of the  in Teddington in 1937.\nAfter World War II, Bragg returned to Cambridge, splitting the  into research groups. He believed that \"the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants\".\nWhen demobilised he returned to crystallography at Cambridge. They had agreed that father would study organic crystals, son would investigate inorganic compounds. In 1919 when , a long-time family friend, moved to Cambridge, Lawrence Bragg replaced him as Langworthy Professor of Physics at the . He recruited an excellent faculty, including former sound rangers, but he believed that his knowledge of physics was weak and he had no classroom experience. The students, many veterans, were critical and rowdy. He was deeply shaken but with family support he pulled himself together and prevailed. He and R. W. James measured the absolute energy of reflected X-rays, which validated a formula derived by C. G. Darwin before the war. Now they could determine the number of electrons in the reflecting targets, and they were able to decipher the structures of more complicated crystals like silicates. It was still difficult: requiring repeated guessing and retrying. In the late 1920s they eased the analysis by using  on the data.\nIn 1930 he became deeply disturbed while weighing a job offer from Imperial College, London. His family rallied around and he recovered his balance while they spent 1931 in Munich, where he did research.\nHe became director of the  in Teddington in 1937, bringing some co-workers along. However, administration and committees took much of his time away from the workbench.\nRutherford died and the search committee named Lawrence Bragg as next in the line of the  who direct the . The Laboratory had an eminent history in atomic physics and some members were wary of a crystallographer, which Bragg surmounted by even-handed administration. He worked on improving the interpretation of diffraction patterns. In the small crystallography group was a refugee research student without a mentor: . He showed Bragg X-ray diffraction data from , which suggested that the structure of giant biological molecules might be deciphered. Bragg appointed Perutz as his research assistant and within a few months obtained additional support with a grant from the . The work was suspended during the Second World War when Perutz was interned as an enemy alien and then worked in military research.\nDuring the war the Cavendish offered a shortened graduate course which emphasised the electronics needed for . Bragg worked on the structure of metals and consulted on sonar and sound ranging, they still used the Tucker microphone. He became Sir Lawrence in 1941. His father died in 1942, during which Bragg served for six months as Scientific Liaison Officer to Canada. He organised periodic conferences on X-ray analysis, which was widely used in military research.\nAfter the war he led in the formation of the  and was elected its first president. He reorganised the Cavendish into units to reflect his conviction that \"the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants, helped by one or more first-class instrument mechanics and a workshop in which the general run of apparatus can be constructed.\" Senior members of staff now had offices, telephones and secretarial support. The scope of the department was enlarged with a new unit on radio astronomy. His own work focused on the structure of metals, using both X-rays and the . In 1947 he persuaded the  (MRC) to support what he described as the \"gallant attempt\" to determine protein structure as the , initially consisting of Perutz,  and two assistants. Bragg worked with them, by 1960 they had resolved the structure of  to the atomic level. After this he was less involved; their analysis of  was easier after they incorporated two mercury atoms as markers in each molecule. The first monumental triumph of the MRC was decoding the structure of DNA by  and . Bragg announced the discovery at a  on proteins in Belgium on 8 April 1953, it went unreported by the press. He then gave a talk at  in London on Thursday 14 May 1953, which resulted in an article by  in the  of London on Friday 15 May 1953, entitled \"Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life\". Bragg nominated Crick, Watson and  for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; Wilkins' share recognised the contribution of X-ray crystallographers at . Among them was , whose \"\" showed that DNA was a double , not the triple helix that  had proposed. Franklin died before the prize (which only goes to living people) was awarded.\nIn 1953 the Braggs moved into the elegant flat for the Resident Professor in the  in London, the position his father had occupied when he died. In 1934 and 1961 Lawrence had delivered the  and since 1938 he had been Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Institution, delivering an annual lecture. His father's successors had weakened the Institution, so Bragg had to rebuild it. He bolstered finances by enlisting corporate sponsors, the traditional Friday Evening Discourses were followed by a dinner party for the speaker and carefully selected possible patrons, more than 120 of them each year. \"Two of these Discourses in 1965 gave him particular pleasure. On 7 May, Lady Bragg, who had been a member of the Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce (1951\u201355) and was Chairman of the , lectured on 'Changing patterns in marriage and divorce'; and on 15 November, Bragg listened with evident pride to the Discourse on 'Oscillations and noise in jet engines' given by his engineer-son , who was then Chief Scientist at Rolls Royce Ltd and later became Vice-Chancellor of .\" He also introduced a programme of highly regarded Schools' Lectures, enlivened by the elaborate demonstrations that were a hallmark of the Institution. He gave three of these lectures on \"electricity\".\nHe continued research in the Institution by recruiting a small group to work the Davy-Faraday Laboratory in the basement and in the adjoining house, supported by grants he obtained. A visitor to the laboratory succeeded in inserting heavy metals into the enzyme ; the structure of its crystal was solved in 1965 at the Royal Institution by  and his coworkers, with the computations on the 9,040 reflections performed on the digital computer at the University of London, which greatly facilitated the work. Two of the illustrations of the positioning of amino acids in the chain were drawn by Bragg. Unlike myoglobin, in which nearly 80 per cent of the amino-acid residues are in the  conformation, in lysozyme the alpha-helix content is only about 40 per cent of the amino-acid residues found in four main stretches. Other stretches are of the , a conformation that they had proposed earlier. In this conformation, every third peptide is hydrogen-bonded back to the first peptide, thus forming a ring containing ten atoms. They had the complete structure of an enzyme in time for Bragg's 75th birthday. He became Professor Emeritus in 1966.\nX-ray analysis of protein structure flourished in subsequent years, determining the structures of scores of proteins in laboratories around the world. Twenty eight Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work using X-ray analysis. The disadvantage of the method is that it must be done on crystals, which precludes seeing changes in shape when enzymes bind substrates and the like. This problem was solved by the development of another line Bragg had initiated, using modified electron microscopes to image single frozen molecules: .\nIn his long association with the  he was:\nIn 1921 he married Alice Hopkinson (1899\u20131989), a cousin of a friend who had been killed in the war.

It was Florey and Chain who actually made a useful and effective drug out of penicillin, after the task had been abandoned as too difficult.\nFlorey's discoveries, along with the discoveries of Fleming and Ernst Chain, are estimated to have saved over 200 million lives, and he is consequently regarded by the Australian scientific and medical community as one of its greatest figures. , Australia's longest-serving , said, \"In terms of world well-being, Florey was the most important man ever born in Australia.\"\nHoward Florey was born in , a southern suburb of , , the youngest of three children and the only son. His father, Joseph Florey, was an English immigrant, and his mother Bertha Mary Florey was a second-generation Australian.\nFlorey was educated at  Preparatory School (now ) and then , where he excelled in chemistry and physics, but not mathematics.

However, the researchers did not have enough penicillin to help him to a full recovery, and he relapsed and died. Because of this experience and the difficulty in producing penicillin, the researchers changed their focus to children, who could be treated with smaller quantities of penicillin.\nFlorey's research team investigated the large-scale production of the mould and efficient extraction of the active ingredient, succeeding to the point where, by 1945, penicillin production was an industrial process for the Allies in World War II. However, Florey said that the project was originally driven by scientific interests, and that the medicinal discovery was a bonus:\nFlorey shared the  in 1945 with Ernst Boris Chain and Alexander Fleming.

For his contributions to Australian science, he was made the first  in 1960, and in 1978 a Knight of the . He was recognised internationally for his achievements: in addition to the Nobel, he received the  and the  and  from the , honorary doctorates, and distinguished service honours from the  and Japan.\nBurnet was born in , ; his father, Frank Burnet, a Scottish emigrant to Australia, was the manager of the Traralgon branch of the Colonial Bank. His mother Hadassah Burnet (n\u00e9e Mackay) was the daughter of a middle-class Scottish immigrant, and met his father when Frank was working in the town of . Frank was 36, and 14 years older than Hadassah. The family was socially conservative Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Frank Macfarlane Burnet was the second of seven children and from childhood was known as \"Mac\". He had an older sister, two younger sisters and three younger brothers. The eldest daughter Doris had a mental disability that consumed most of Hadassah's time and the family saw Doris's condition as an unspoken stigma, discouraging the other children from inviting friends home, lest they come across the eldest daughter. From his early years in Traralgon, Mac enjoyed exploring the environment around him, particularly Traralgon Creek. He first attended a private school run by a single teacher before starting at the government primary school at the age of 7. Mac was distant from his father\u2014who liked to spend his free time fishing and playing golf\u2014from a young age. He preferred bookish pursuits from a young age and was not enamoured of sport, and by the age of eight was old enough to analyse his father's character; Mac disapproved of Frank and saw him as a hypocrite who espoused moral principles and put on a facade of uprightedness, while associating with businessmen of dubious ethics. Hadassah was preoccupied with Doris, so Mac developed a rather solitary personality.\nThe Burnets moved to  in 1909, when Frank was posted to be the bank manager there, having declined a post in London. Burnet was interested in the wildlife around the nearby ; he joined the  in 1910 and enjoyed all outdoor activities. While living in Terang, he began to collect  and study biology. He read biology articles in the , which introduced him to the work of . During his early teens, the family took annual holidays to , where Burnet spent his time observing and recording the behaviour of the wildlife. He was educated at Terang State School and attended Sunday school at the local church, where the priest encouraged him to pursue scholastic studies and awarded him a book on ants as a reward for his academic performance. He advised Frank to invest in Mac's education and he won a full scholarship to board and study at , one of Victoria's most exclusive private schools. Starting there in 1913, Burnet was the only boarder with a full scholarship. He did not enjoy his time there among the scions of the ruling upper class; while most of his peers were brash and sports-oriented, Burnet was bookish and not athletically inclined, and found his fellow students to be arrogant and boorish. During this period he kept his beetle-collecting and disapproval of his peers a secret and mixed with his schoolmates out of necessity. Nevertheless, his academic prowess gained him privileges, and he graduated in 1916, placing first in his school overall, and in history, English, chemistry and physics. The typical university path for a person of his social background was to pursue studies in theology, law or medicine. By this time, he was becoming disillusioned with religion and chose medicine. Due to World War I, military service was a possibility and he felt that a medical background would increase his chances of being given a non-combat post.\nFrom 1918, Burnet attended the , where he lived in  on a residential scholarship. There, he read more of Darwin's work and was influenced by the ideas of science and society in the writings of . He enjoyed his time at university and spent much of his free time reading biology books in the library to feed his passion for scientific knowledge. He also had fleeting sporting success, holding down a position in Ormond's First VIII rowing squad for a brief period. He continued to pursue his study of beetles in private, although his classmates found out and there was no loss in this as they viewed his hobby positively. Despite an ongoing shyness, Burnet got on well with staff and students at university. Burnet was self-motivated and often skipped lectures to study at his own faster pace and pursue further knowledge in the library, and he came equal first in physics and chemistry in first year. The following year, 1918, he became increasingly immersed in laboratory work, but he was also dogged by peer pressure to enlist in the , which he saw as a distasteful prospect. However, this was averted by the end of the . In 1919, he was one of 12 high-performing students selected for extra tuition, and he came equal first in third year physiology. He began clinical work in the same year, but found it somewhat unpleasant as he was interested in diagnosing the patient and had little interest in showing empathy towards them.\nWhile at university, he became an  and later an aggressive atheist; he was sceptical of religious faith, which he regarded as \"an effort to believe what common sense tells you isn't true.\" He was also disgusted by what he regarded as hypocritical conduct by religious adherents. Towards the later years of his undergraduate years, his unhappiness with religion began to dog him to a greater extent. He tried to become involved with  for a brief period but then resolved to devote himself to scientific research. The length of time required to study medicine had been reduced to five years to train doctors faster following the outbreak of , and Burnet graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and a Bachelor of Surgery in 1922, ranking second in the final exams despite the death of his father a few weeks earlier. His fellow graduates included , , , Rupert Willis and , who became distinguished scientists in their own right.\nHe then did a ten-month residency at  to gain experience before going into practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under  and , both well known surgeons. He enjoyed this period immensely and was disappointed when he had to do his medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist , whom Burnet came to idolise. As a result of this he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the  was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, who was in charge of such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more suited to a laboratory research career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. Burnet complied.\nDuring the transition period he worked as a pathology registrar at the  and also prepared for his Doctor of Medicine examinations, late in 1923. In 1923 he took up the post of senior resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital; the laboratories were a part of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He conducted research into the  reactions in , leading to his first scientific publications. He decided to work full-time on the  response in , even though he was technically supposed to pursuing  as part of his obligations to the hospital. Burnet came first in the Doctor of Medicine exams by a long distance, and his score was excluded from the scaling process so that the other students would not fail for being so far behind.\nAt the time, the Hall Institute was in the early stages of rapid expansion. The new director of the Institute, , wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in ,  and  that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to Burnet and saw him as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on  in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the  at the  in . Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was free to do his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if  was affected by .\nHe was awarded the  by the Lister Institute in 1926; this gave him enough money for him to resign his curator position and he began full-time research on bacteriophages. He injected mice with bacteriophage and observed their immunological reactions and believed bacteriophages to be . For this work he received a Ph.D. from the  in 1928 under the direction of Professor  and was invited to write a chapter on bacteriophages for the  . He was also given an invitation to deliver a paper at the  in 1927 on the link between O-agglutinins and bacteriophage. Burnet began attending the  functions and befriended some communists, although he refrained from joining them in overt left-wing activism. He also spent his free time enjoying theatre, engaging in amateur  and cycling through continental Europe.\nWhile in London, Burnet became engaged to fellow Australian Edith Linda Marston Druce. She was a secondary school teacher and daughter of a barrister's clerk and the pair had met in 1923 and had a few dates but did not keep in touch. Druce sought out Burnet while on a holiday in London and they quickly agreed to marriage although she had to return to Australia. They married in 1928 after he had completed his Ph.D. and returned to Australia, and had a son and two daughters. At the time, there was a vacancy for the Chair of Bacteriology at the University of London, and Ledingham was lobbying his colleagues to offer Burnet the post, but Burnet returned to Australia, partly because of Druce.\nWhen Burnet returned to Australia, he went back to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, where he was appointed assistant director by Kellaway. His first assignment was to investigate the \"Bundaberg disaster\", in which 12 children had died after receiving a contaminated  vaccine. Kellaway was put in charge of a  to investigate the matter and he put Burnet in charge of the laboratory investigations. He identified  in the toxin- mixture that had been administered to the children; it had been picked up from the skin of one of the children and then transmitted to the others in the injections. However, it turned out to be another toxin that had caused the children's deaths; this work on staphylococcal toxin piqued his interest in immunology. During this time, he continued to study bacteriophages, writing 32 papers on phages between 1924 and 1937. In 1929, Burnet and his graduate assistant Margot McKie wrote a paper suggesting that bacteriophages could exist as a stable non-infectious form that multiplies with the bacterial host. Their pioneering description of  was not accepted until much later, and was crucial to the work of ,  and  on the replication mechanism and genetics of viruses, for which they were awarded the 1969 .\nBetween 1932 and 1933, Burnet took leave of absence to undertake a fellowship at the  in London. The Great Depression had resulted in Burnet's salary being cut from 1000 to 750 pounds, and the National Institute had been given a large grant from the  that allowed them to hire Burnet at 1000 pounds per annum. The National Institute's Director Sir  gained permission from Kellaway for the two-year move; Kellaway promised to hold Burnet's job for him when he returned and felt that the experience would make Burnet\u2014whom he saw as the Hall Institute's brightest young scientist\u2014better equipped to expand operations when he returned to Melbourne. Dale also paid for Burnet's sister to travel to England to help look after her brother's young children.\nSignificant breakthroughs in virology were made while he was there, including the isolation and first demonstration of the transmission of the  virus. His own research was on the , which he used in developing a chick embryo assay for the isolation and quantification of animal viruses. Dale offered Burnet a permanent position but he declined and returned to the Hall Institute. Following his productive work in London, the Rockefeller Institute agreed to fund a new virus research laboratory in Melbourne for Burnet. He brought back a set of viruses from the National Institute to begin the basis of research in Melbourne.\nWhen Burnet returned to Australia, he continued his work on virology, including the  of . He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of  and . After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban in order to prevent human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist , the causative organism of which was named  in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of herpes and Q fever displayed an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his scientific method.\nDuring World War II, Burnet's research moved to  and . With the outbreak of war, Burnet was handed more responsibility and made acting director and had to oversee the move into a new building as Kellaway was seconded to the military in 1939. Due to Kellaway, many of the infectious disease problems afflicting the military were referred to the Institute. Fearing a repeat of the massive global influenza outbreak that occurred after World War I, Burnet focused the Institute in the search for a vaccine. He first tested the vaccine on a group of medical students, and after a promising test on 107 army volunteers in February 1942 following a rise in infections, a large-scale program was introduced two months later to inoculate all new recruits after an influenza A outbreak. In this trial, 20,000 personnel were vaccinated, without success, and the scheme was abandoned. In 1942, the investigations into scrub typhus accelerated after an exodus of researchers in that field from  after the  conquest of the area. However, this ended in tragedy when his collaborator  accidentally injected herself and then died of the infection. Nevertheless, his work on immunisation had earned him international recognition by this time.\nBurnet's first book, , was published in 1940. It had wide influence and was translated into several languages. In 1942 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1944 he travelled to  to deliver the Dunham Lectures. There he was offered a chair, but he refused and returned to Australia. This was attributed to his nationalistic tendencies, as well as his sense of loyalty to the Hall Institute. During his trip he also visited the US military facility at , where he discussed his work on influenza with the scientists working there.\nIn 1944, he was appointed director of the Institute when Kellaway was appointed director of the . Although Kellaway had groomed Burnet to become a pivotal figure, he was hesitant as to whether Burnet would be at his most effective with a strategic leadership role. Kellaway thought that Burnet might not be suited to the post, and should have continued to focus purely on research for the time being. Burnet had similar doubts, particularly given his taciturn nature, but applied for the position anyway. Although he was not known for his social skills, his ability as a scientist and to impart ideas for investigation to his subordinates held his leadership and the Institute in good stead. Unlike his predecessor, who valued a broad gamut of research activities, Burnet was of the opinion that the Institute could not make a significant impact at global level in this way, and he pursued a policy of focusing all effort into one area at a time. Always a strong-willed and rather isolated man, he became more single-minded and less tolerant of criticism of his work and expected a more hierarchical structure and unquestioning obedience. According to biographer Sexton, he \"displayed a kind of territorial protectiveness in relation to his own work\".\nIn 1944, it was decided by the University of Melbourne that Burnet would be appointed a professor as part of a cooperative program so that university students could be experimentally trained at the Institute, while the researchers engaged in some teaching. This was not a success, and there was much tension, as Burnet repeatedly expressed his opinion in public that university teaching and research should be kept separate, at one point leading to a series of open letters from university professors decrying his attitude. Burnet was also not interested in the politics of university funding, and his disengagement from administrative matters engendered resentment. On the other hand, Burnet was vigorous in obtaining funding for the Hall Institute from government bodies, resorting to the bluff of feigning interest in moving overseas to secure continued strong backing. However, he was criticised for being thrifty and refusing to invest in cutting edge equipment, despite the Hall Institute's high standing in research circles. Colleagues believed that he was sceptical of modern technology and thought his outlook to be limiting.\nIn 1946, he initiated the Clinical Research Unit to allow for closer cooperation with the clinical activities of the now named . Despite his known derisive views of clinical science as being inferior, he supported the work enthusiastically.\nUnder Burnet's direction, scientists at the Institute made significant contributions to infectious disease research during a period that has been called the \"golden age of virology\". Virologists including , , , , and  made significant contributions on , , , , herpes and influenza.\nBurnet made significant contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including  assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the  that is secreted by , which later provided the foundation for  significant work on  and the neuraminidase substrate, . Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.\nIn 1957, Burnet decided that research at the Institute should focus on immunology. Burnet reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned and feeling the action was arrogant; for Burnet's part he was comfortable with the decision as he thought it to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the 's . After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on immunological problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to  and the  reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of immunology, immunological surveillance and cancer.\nAt the time, immunology was becoming more sophisticated, with the increasing role of  and . Burnet was suspicious of the direction in which immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude was a factor in his decision to turn the Institute's focus to immunology.\nBurnet began to switch his focus to immunology in the 1940s. In 1941 he wrote a  called \"The Production of Antibodies\", which was revised and reissued in 1949 with Frank Fenner as a co-author. This book is seen as a key publication in immunology\u2014it marks the move from the study of immunology as a chemical endeavour to a biological one. Importantly in this work, he introduced the concept of \"self\" and \"non-self\" to immunology. The distinction between self and non-self was an integral part of Burnet's biological outlook, of his interest in the living organism in its totality, its activities, and interactions. Burnet regarded the \"self\" of the host body as being actively defined during its embryogenesis through complex interactions between immune cells and all the other cells and molecules within an embryo.\nUsing the concept of self, Burnet introduced a hypothesis about the situation where the body failed to make antibodies to its own components () and by extension the idea of . He proposed that\nBurnet was, however, unable to prove this experimentally. ,  and  did find support for Burnet's hypothesis in 1953 when they showed that  could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not from any other mouse strain. Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet and Medawar were able to coordinate their work effectively despite their rather different personalities and physical separation; Burnet was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.\nHowever, later studies showed that cells or tissues transplanted before the immune system development of the recipient, such as in embryonic recipients, could be treated as foreign and trigger rejection, countering Burnet's explanation for self tolerance. In contrast to the Burnet hypothesis of a special tolerance-inducing period defined by the age of the animal,  proposed in 1959, that it is the age of the lymphocyte that defines whether an antigen that is encountered will induce tolerance, with immature lymphocytes being tolerance-sensitive. Lederberg's concept is now known as central tolerance, and is widely accepted. It may also explain the success of some transplants given early in life and the failure to induce tolerance in other studies. Burnet noted that his contributions to immune tolerance were strictly theoretical:\nBurnet was interested in how the body produces antibodies in response to antigens. The dominant idea in the literature through the 1940s was that the antigen acted as a template for antibody production, which was known as the \"instructive\" hypothesis. Burnet was not satisfied with this explanation, and in the second edition of \"The Production of Antibodies\", he and Fenner advanced an indirect template theory which proposed that each antigen could influence the genome, thus effecting the production of antibodies. In 1956 he became interested in 's natural selection hypothesis, which described a mechanism for immune response based on an earlier theory of Nobel-winning immunologist . Jerne proposed that the antigen bound to an antibody by chance and, that upon binding, more antibodies to that antigen would be produced. Burnet developed a model which he named  that expanded on and improved Jerne's hypothesis. Burnet proposed that each  bears on its surface specific immunoglobulins reflecting the specificity of the antibody that will later be synthesised once the cell is activated by an antigen. The antigen serves as a selective stimulus, causing preferential proliferation and differentiation of\nthe clones that have receptors for that antigen.\nIn 1958  and Lederberg showed that one  always produces only one antibody, which was the first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book . His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and  as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.\nThere is some contention over Burnet's publication of his version of the theory in the  in 1957. Some commentators argue he published in an Australian journal to fast-track his hypothesis and obtain priority for his theory over ideas that were published later that year in a paper written by , which Burnet had read prior to its publication. In his paper Burnet cited Talmage's review, and in a later interview, Talmage said he believed that Burnet \"truthfully had developed the idea before he received my paper\". The theory is now sometimes known as Burnet's clonal selection theory, which overlooks the contributions of Ehrlich, Jerne, Talmage, and the contributions of Lederberg, who conceptualised the genetics of clonal selection.\nBurnet's work on graft-versus-host was in collaboration with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this was known as the Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain  in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune . They looked at the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug  to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human autoimmune disease.\nIn 1960, Burnet scaled back his laboratory work, taking one day off per week to concentrate on writing. In 1963, , which he authored with , was published. He also oversaw an expansion of the Hall Institute and secured funding from the  and the state government to build two further floors in the building and take over some of the space taken up by the pathology department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Despite this, Burnet believed that a world class research body needed to be small enough that one person could effectively run it, and maintained tight control over its activities throughout his leadership. He determined the policies himself, and personally selected all of the research staff and students, relying on a small staff to enforce his plans.\nHe continued to be active in the laboratory until his retirement in 1965, although his experimental time began to decrease as the operations became increasingly focused on immunology; Burnet's work in this area had been mostly theoretical. Gustav Nossal became the next director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. Under Burnet's leadership the Institute had become \"probably the world's best known research centre devoted to the study of immunology.\" However, with the increasing sophistication in medical science and its reliance on more complicated technology, Burnet's lone-wolf approach became less compatible with the research environment, which required more collaboration. In his final years at the helm, Burnet allowed more technical modernisation during the transition period to Nossal's leadership.\nFrom 1937 Burnet was involved in a variety of scientific and public policy bodies, starting with a position on a government advisory council on polio. After he became the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1944, he was considered a public figure and overcame shyness to become a good public speaker. He recognised the importance of co-operation with the media if the general public was to understand science and scientists, and his writings and lectures played an important part in the formulation of public attitudes and policy in Australia on a variety of biological topics. However, despite making many appearances on radio and television, he never became at ease with interviews and had to be selective with outreach engagements due to the many invitations he received, and tended to accept those that had the potential to promote the Institute. Over time, he began to increase his activism, as he felt more confident that he would be able to make an impact as his reputation grew, especially after winning the Nobel Prize, and even more so after his retirement from the directorship of the Institute. Although Burnet was not naturally outgoing, he saw it as the social responsibility of a scientific leader and scholar to publicly speak out and impart wisdom and foresight to the wider community.\nBurnet served as a member or chairman of scientific committees, both in Australia and overseas. Between 1947 and 1953, he was a member of the 's Medical Research Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for medical research in Australia. During this same period (1947\u201352), he was also a member of the  Defence Research and Development Policy Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that Burnet made the recommendation that Australia pursue development of  and  to target neighbouring countries' food stocks and spread infectious diseases. His report was titled . Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; he was concerned that Australians were being exposed to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.\nInternationally, Burnet was a chairman of the Papua New Guinea Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1962 and 1969. At the time, Papua New Guinea was an Australian territory, and Burnet had first travelled there as his son was posted there. His role on the committee allowed him to explore his interest in . He was particularly interested in  (laughing sickness), and lobbied the Australian government to establish the Papua New Guinea Institute of Human Biology. Burnet later helped oversee the institute's contribution to the Anglo-Australian participation in the International Biological Programme in the Field of Human Adaptability.\nBurnet served as first chair for the  (1966\u201369), a Commonwealth initiative to foster interaction between the member countries' elite, and he was also active in the , serving on the Expert Advisory Panels on Virus Diseases and on Immunology between 1952 and 1969 and the World Health Organization Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1969 and 1973.\nIn 1964, he was appointed to sit on the University Council of Victoria's third university  on an interim basis until the institution was formed in 1966. He served until 1970. He advocated a less hierarchical relationship between a professor and student, something seen as a move away from the English tradition prevalent in Australia towards an American model. He also called for the downgrading of the importance placed on the liberal arts. His ideas were too radical for his peers and he stepped down from the role in 1970 after none of his suggestions had made an impact.\nBurnet was opposed to the use of nuclear power in Australia owing to the issues of . He later retracted his objections to , feeling that nuclear power was necessary while other renewable energy sources were being developed. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he was also vocal in the anti-smoking movement; he was one of the first high-profile figures in Australia to educate the public on the dangers of tobacco, and he appeared in a television advertisement criticising the ethics of , and broadcasters for displaying such material. He and fellow activists were surprised that the commercial was allowed to run briefly, before being taken off air by the station, which only further generated attention for the anti-smoking campaign. A former smoker, he had rejected the habit in the 1950s after several friends died. Burnet was also a critic of the  and called for the creation of an international police force.\nFollowing his resignation from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an office at the  in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books on a variety of topics including immunology, ageing and cancer, and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled , which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He was known for his ability to write quickly, often without a final draft, and his ability to convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had much influence. In 1969 he published , considered his magnum opus on immunity, which attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the clonal selection theory. The following year, he wrote , which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused work schedule, often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.\nHe became president of the  in 1965, having been a foundational fellow when the Academy was formed in 1954. He had been offered the presidency in 1958 to replace the inaugural head Sir , but declined, although he served on the council and as vice president in 1961\u201363. As president he was recognised by both government and the public as the leading scientist in Australia. His stature as a scientist gave him the gravitas to end policy disputes, and gave the Academy and its advocacy more credibility in the eyes of government and industry. As such his term was considered to be highly successful. Oliphant said that Burnet's personal prestige was very important in the increased respect the AAS won and that he \"made the biological sciences far more acceptable in Australia\".\nHe helped establish the Academy's Science and Industry Forum, which was formed in the second year of his leadership in order to improve dialogue between researchers and industrialists. It investigated whether a national science policy should be formulated and led to the eventual creation of the . He also laid the foundations of the . When his presidency ended in 1969, the Academy founded the , which is the Academy's highest award for biological sciences.\nAs in many of his previous pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group of the scientific community and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful due to a lack of concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members\u2014such as Burnet\u2014being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.\nIn 1966, Burnet accepted a nomination from Australia Prime Minister Sir  to become the inaugural chairman of the , a body that aimed to increase the professional interchange between the various nations of the . Burnet served in the role for three years and helped start it on a path of steady growth, although he was unable to use it as a personal platform to  espouse the importance of human biology.\nBurnet's essays and books published in his later life caused contention within the scientific community and to the chagrin of his peers Burnet often made pessimistic proclamations about the future of science. In 1966 Burnet wrote an opinion article for  entitled \"Men or Molecules?\" in which he questioned the usefulness of , arguing that it had not and would not contribute anything of use to medicine and that manipulation of the genome as had been demonstrated in bacteria would do more harm to humans than good. Gustav Nossal subsequently described Burnet as \"a biologist with a love-hate affair with biochemistry, which led to a brief but damaging rejection of the worth of molecular biology.\"\nHe delivered the inaugural Oscar Mendelsohn lecture in 1971 at  and advocated policies for Australia such as population control, prevention of war, long-term plans for the management of the environment and natural resources, Aboriginal land rights, socialism, recycling, advertising bans on socially harmful products, and more regulation of the environment. He angrily denounced French nuclear testing in the Pacific, and after consistently voting for the ruling Liberal Party coalition as it ruled for the past few decades, signed an open letter backing the opposition Labor Party of , which took power in 1972. However, he soon spoke out against Whitlam's lack of action against tobacco advertising and French nuclear tests. Burnet often found himself frustrated with the refusal of politicians to base policy on long-term objectives, such as the sustainability of human life.\nIn 1971\u201372, he wrote four books, most notably, , which caused great controversy due to its strident attacks on molecular biology, cellular biology, and claims that cancer and various other diseases were incurable and that it was pointless to try to do so. He also predicted that scientific progress would end soon.\nBurnet spoke and wrote widely on the topic of human biology after his retirement, aiming to reach all strata of society. He courted the media as well as the scientific community, often leading to sensationalist or scientifically unrigorous report of his outspoken views. This often angered colleagues, who viewed him as abusing his stature to deliberately cause a stir.  In 1966 Burnet presented the , focusing on human biology. He provided a conceptual framework for sustainable development; 21 years later the definition provided by the  was almost identical. In 1970 he revised an earlier book which was published as ; it was followed by , which was published in 1978. The books discuss aspects of human biology, a topic which Burnet wrote on extensively in his later years. In  he argued that the roots of all human behaviour can be found in the behaviour of animals; in  he addressed issues of ageing, life, death and the future of mankind. The books strongly polarised the scientific community, and one reviewer described his ideas of sociobiology as \"extreme\" and giving \"a dismal, unappealing view of humanity\". In , he also called for society to accept euthanasia of ill older people, repeat violent criminals, and most controversially, abortion of pregnancies likely to result in disabled children, and infanticide of handicapped newborns. Knowing that there would be a strong backlash for such policies, he departed overseas for a two-month lecture series at the time of the book launch. In his absence, he was strongly assailed in newspaper letters and some correspondents compared his stance on infanticide to that of . At the same time, he also changed his stance on nuclear power and advocated its use, and the reinvestment of revenue for research into solar power. This about face angered the environmental movement.\nHis first wife, Edith Linda Druce, died from lymphoid leukaemia in 1973, after a four-year struggle. During her final years, Burnet refused all offers of lectures overseas to spend more time nursing his ailing wife. For a period after this he became very lethargic and reclusive, numbed by his wife's death. He then moved into Ormond College for company, and resumed beetle collecting, but for a year after her death, Burnet tried to alleviate his grief by writing mock letters to her once a week. Gradually he regained his enthusiasm and began writing again. In 1975, he travelled to California to deliver a series of lectures. In 1976 he married Hazel G. Jenkins, a widowed former singer from a business family in her 70s who was working in the microbiology department as a librarian, and moved out of Ormond College.\nIn 1978 Burnet decided to officially retire; in retirement he wrote two books. During this time, he missed his laboratory work, and he was constrained to social events and theorising. In 1982, Burnet was one of three contributors to , writing about genetic issues and their impact on the nation's impact. As a result of the success of the book, in early 1983, Burnet was appointed to the 70-person Australian Advisory Council of Elders to offer counsel to policymakers, but the group folded after several members became too frail or died.\nBurnet continued to travel and speak, but in the early 1980s, he and his wife became increasingly hampered by illness. Having surmised his illness two years earlier, in November 1984 he underwent surgery for . He made plans to resume scientific meetings, but was then taken ill again, with significant pain in his thorax and legs. Secondary lesions were found in June 1985 and declared to be inoperable and terminal. A supporter of euthanasia, Burnet was unfazed by his imminent death, and he died on 31 August at his son's home at  after two months' of illness. He was given a state funeral by the government of Australia; many of his distinguished colleagues from the Hall Institute such as Nossal and Fenner were pall-bearers, and he was buried near his paternal grandparents after a private family service at  in Koroit, near Port Fairy. Following his death he was honoured by the ; Prime Minister  took the highly unusual step of moving a condolence motion, an honour typically reserved for parliamentarians. Lady Hazel Burnet died in 1990.\nBurnet received extensive honours for his contributions to science and public life during his lifetime. He was  in the , received the Elizabeth II Coronation Medal in 1953, and was appointed to the  (OM) in the 1958 . In 1960 he was the first recipient of the honorary  award. He received a Gold and Silver Star from the Japanese  in 1961.  He was appointed  (KBE) in the , and received the Elizabeth II Jubilee Medal in 1977. In 1978 he was made a  (AK). He was only the fourth person to receive this honour.\nHe was a fellow or honorary member of 30 international Academies of Sciences. He received 10 honorary  degrees from universities including Cambridge, Harvard and Oxford, an honorary  degree from Hahnemann Medical College (now part of ), an honorary Doctor of Medical Science from the  and a  degree from the University of Melbourne. Including his Nobel, he received 19 medals or awards including the  and the  from the Royal Society and the ; he also received 33 international lectureships and 17 lectureships within Australia.\nAfter his death, Australia's largest communicable diseases research institute\u2014the  was renamed in his honour. The Burnet Clinical Research Unit of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute was also named in his honour in 1986. In 1975 his work on immunology was recognised by a 33-cent stamp released by . Seven Australian medical scientists were commemorated in the issue of a set of four Australian stamps released in 1995; he appears on the 45-cent stamp with fellow University of Melbourne graduate . He also appears on a  stamp that was issued in 1997. The centenary of his birth was celebrated in Australia in 1999; a statue of him was erected in Franklin Street, Traralgon; and several events were held in his honour including the release of a new edition of  by Oxford University Press.\nBurnet biographer Christopher Sexton suggests that Burnet's legacy is fourfold: (1) the scope and quality of his research; (2) his nationalistic attitude which led him to stay in Australia, leading to the development of science in Australia and inspiring future generations of Australian scientists; (3) his success establishing the reputation of Australian medical research worldwide; and (4) his books, essays and other writings. In spite of his sometimes controversial ideas on science and humanity,  has noted that \"Burnet's reputation is secure in his achievements as an experimentalist, a theoretician and a leader of the Australian scientific community.\"\n\n\n"},

He shared the prize with  and .\nEccles was born in , Australia. He grew up there with his two sisters and his parents: William and Mary Carew Eccles (both teachers, who  him until he was 12). He initially attended Warrnambool High School (now ) (where a science wing is named in his honour), then completed his final year of schooling at . Aged 17, he was awarded a senior scholarship to study medicine at the . As a medical undergraduate, he was never able to find a satisfactory explanation for the interaction of mind and body; he started to think about becoming a neuroscientist. He graduated (with first class honours) in 1925, and was awarded a  to study under  at , , where he received his Doctor of Philosophy in 1929.\nIn 1937 Eccles returned to Australia, where he worked on military research during . During this time Eccles was the director of Kanematsu Institute at , he and  gave research lectures at the , strongly influencing its intellectual environment. After the war, he became a professor at the  in New Zealand. From 1952 to 1962 he worked as a professor at the  (JCSMR) of the . The Eccles Institute of Neuroscience is headquartered in a new wing of the JCSMR building, constructed with the assistance of a $63M grant from the Commonwealth Government and completed in March 2012.\nIn the early 1950s, Eccles and his colleagues performed the research that would lead to his receiving the Nobel Prize. To study synapses in the peripheral nervous system, Eccles and colleagues used the stretch reflex as a model, which is easily studied because it consists of only two : a sensory neuron (the  fibre) and the . The sensory neuron synapses onto the motor neuron in the . When a current is passed into the sensory neuron in the , the motor neuron innervating the quadriceps produced a small  (EPSP). When a similar current is passed through the , the opposing muscle to the quadriceps, an  (IPSP) is produced in the quadriceps motor neuron. Although a single EPSP was not enough to fire an  in the motor neuron, the sum of several EPSPs from multiple sensory neurons synapsing onto the motor neuron can cause the motor neuron to fire, thus contracting the quadriceps. On the other hand, IPSPs could subtract from this sum of EPSPs, preventing the motor neuron from firing.\nApart from these seminal experiments, Eccles was key to a number of important developments in . Until around 1949, Eccles believed that  was primarily electrical rather than chemical. Although he was wrong in this hypothesis, his arguments led him and others to perform some of the experiments which proved chemical synaptic transmission.  and Eccles worked together on some of the experiments which elucidated the role of  as a  in the brain.\nHe was appointed a  in 1958 in recognition of services to physiological research.\nHe won the  Award in 1963, the same year he won the Nobel Prize.\nIn 1964 he became an honorary member to the , and in 1966 he moved to the United States to work at the  in Chicago. Unhappy with the working conditions there, he left to become a professor at the  from 1968 until he retired in 1975. After retirement, he moved to Switzerland and wrote on the .\nIn 1981, Eccles became a founding member of the .\nIn 1990 he was appointed a  of the  (AC) in recognition of service to science, particularly in the field of neurophysiology. He died in 1997 in , , Switzerland.\nIn  (1973), Eccles summarises his philosophy: \"Now before discussing brain function in detail I will at the beginning give an account of my philosophical position on the so-called 'brain-mind problem' so that you will be able to relate the experimental evidence to this philosophical position. I have written at length on this philosophy in my book . In Fig. 6-1 you will be able to see that I fully accept the recent philosophical achievements of  with his concept of three worlds. I was a , now I am a ! Cartesian dualism has become unfashionable with many people. They embrace  to escape the enigma of brain-mind interaction with its perplexing problems. But Sir Karl Popper and I are , and what is more, ! The three worlds are very easily defined. I believe that in the classification of Fig. 6-1 there is nothing left out. It takes care of everything that is in existence and in our experience. All can be classified in one or other of the categories enumerated under Worlds 1, 2 and 3.\n\n\"In Fig. 6-1, World 1 is the world of physical objects and states. It comprises the whole cosmos of matter and energy, all of biology including human brains, and all artifacts that man has made for coding information, as for example, the paper and ink of books or the material base of works of art. World 1 is the total world of the materialists. They recognise nothing else. All else is fantasy.\n\"World 2 is the world of states of consciousness and subjective knowledge of all kinds. The totality of our perceptions comes in this world. But there are several levels. In agreement with Polten, I tend to recognise three kinds of levels of World 2, as indicated in Fig. 6-2, but it may be more correct to think of it as a spectrum.\nFIG. 6-2, World of Consciousness\n\"The first level (outer sense) would be the ordinary perceptions provided by all our sense organs, hearing and touch and sight and smell and pain. All of these perceptions are in World 2, of course: vision with light and colour; sound with music and harmony; touch with all its qualities and vibration; the range of odours and tastes, and so on. These qualities do not exist in World 1, where correspondingly there are but electromagnetic waves, pressure waves in the atmosphere, material objects, and chemical substances.\n\"In addition there is a level of , which is the world of more subtle perceptions. It is the world of your emotions, of your feelings of joy and sadness and fear and anger and so on. It includes all your memory, and all your imaginings and planning into the future. In fact there is a whole range of levels which could be described at length. All the subtle experiences of the human person are in this inner sensory world. It is all private to you but you can reveal it in linguistic expression, and by gestures of all levels of subtlety.\n\"Finally, at the core of World 2 there is the  or , which is the basis of our unity as an experiencing being throughout our whole lifetime.\n\"This World 2 is our . Our conscious experiences are the basis of our knowledge of World 1, which is thus a world of , a derivative world. Whenever I am doing a scientific experiment, for example, I have to plan it cognitively, all in my thoughts, and then consciously carry out my plan of action in the experiment. Finally I have to look at the results and evaluate them in thought. For example, I have to see the traces of the oscilloscope and their photographic records or hear the signals on the loudspeaker. The various signals from the recording equipment have to be received by my sense organs, transmitted to my brain, and so to my consciousness, then appropriately measured and compared before I can begin to think about the significance of the experimental results. We are all the time, in every action we do, incessantly playing backwards and forwards between World 1 and World 2.\n\"And what is World 3? As shown in Fig. 6-1 it is the whole world of culture. It is the world that was created by man and that reciprocally made man. This is my message in which I follow Popper unreservedly. The whole of language is here. All our means of communication, all our intellectual efforts coded in books, coded in the artistic and technological treasures in the museums, coded in every artefact left by man from primitive times\u2014this is World 3 right up to the present time. It is the world of civilisation and culture. Education is the means whereby each human being is brought into relation with World 3. In this manner he becomes immersed in it throughout life, participating in the heritage of mankind and so becoming fully human. World 3 is the world that uniquely relates to man. It is the world which is completely unknown to animals. They are blind to all of World 3. I say that without any reservations. This is then the first part of my story.\n\"Now I come to consider the way in which the three worlds interact...\"\nDespite these words, in his late book , Eccles proposed a dualistic mechanism of mind.\nEccles had nine children. Eccles married Irene Miller Eccles (1904-2002) in 1928 and divorced in 1968. After his divorce in 1968, Eccles married Helena T\u00e1bor\u00edkov\u00e1; a fellow neuropsychologist and M.D. of Charles University. The two often collaborated in research and they remained married until his death. Eccles died on 2 May 1997 in his home of . He was buried in Contra, Switzerland.\n"},

White was also the inaugural recipient of the .\nWhite was born in , London, to Victor Martindale White and Ruth (n\u00e9e Withycombe), both Australians, in their apartment overlooking  on 28 May 1912. His family returned to Sydney, Australia, when he was six months old. As a child he lived in a flat with his sister, a nanny, and a maid while his parents lived in an adjoining flat.  In 1916 they moved to a house in  that many years later became a nursing home, Lulworth House, the residents of which included , , and White's partner .\nAt the age of four, White developed asthma, a condition that had taken the life of his maternal grandfather. White's health was fragile throughout his childhood, which precluded his participation in many childhood activities.\nHe loved the theatre, which he first visited at an early age (his mother took him to see  at the age of six). This love was expressed at home when he performed private rites in the garden and danced for his mother's friends.\nAt the age of five, he attended kindergarten at Sandtoft in , in Sydney's .\nAt the age of ten, White was sent to , a boarding school in  in the  of New South Wales, in an attempt to abate his asthma. It took him some time to adjust to the presence of other children. At boarding school, he started to write plays. Even at this early age, White wrote about palpably adult themes. In 1924, the boarding school ran into financial trouble, and the headmaster suggested for White to be sent to a  in England, a suggestion that his parents accepted.\nWhite struggled to adjust to his new surroundings at , England. He later described it as \"a four-year prison sentence\". White withdrew socially and had a limited circle of acquaintances. Occasionally, he would holiday with his parents at European locations, but their relationship remained distant. However he did spend time with his cousin Jack Withycombe during this period, and Jack's daughter  became a mentor to him while he was writing his first book of poems,  between the years 1927\u201329.\nWhile at school in London, White made one close friend, Ronald Waterall, an older boy who shared similar interests. White's biographer, , wrote that \"the two men would walk, arm-in-arm, to London shows; and stand around stage doors crumbing for a glimpse of their favourite stars, giving a practical demonstration of a chorus girl's high kick... with appropriate vocal accompaniment\". When Waterall left school, White withdrew again. He asked his parents if he could leave school to become an actor. The parents compromised and allowed him to finish school early if he came home to Australia to try life on the land. His parents felt that he should work on the land rather than become a writer and hoped that his work as a  would temper his artistic ambitions.\nWhite spent two years working as a  at Bolaro, a 73-square-kilometre (28\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) station near , on the edge of the , in southeastern Australia. Although he grew to respect the land and his health improved, it was clear that he was not cut out for this life.\nFrom 1932 to 1935, White lived in England, studying French and German literature at , . During his time at Cambridge he developed a romantic attraction to a young man who had come to King's College to become an Anglican priest. White dared not speak of his feelings for fear of losing the friendship and, like many other gay men of that period, he feared that his sexuality would doom him to a lonely life. Then, one night, the student priest, after an awkward liaison with two women, admitted to White that women meant nothing to him sexually. That became White's first love affair.\nDuring White's time at Cambridge he published a collection of poetry entitled , and wrote a play named , which was later performed by an amateur group (which included his sister Suzanne) at the tiny  in Sydney. After being admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1935, White briefly settled in London, where he lived in an area that was frequented by artists. There, the young author thrived creatively for a time, writing several unpublished works and reworking , a novel that he had written while jackarooing. In 1937, White's father died, leaving him ten thousand pounds in inheritance. The fortune enabled him to write full-time in relative comfort. Two more plays followed before he succeeded in finding a publisher for . The novel was received well in London but poorly in Australia. He began writing another novel, , but abandoned it before its completion after receiving negative comments, a decision that he later admitted regretting.\nIn 1936, White met the painter , 18 years his senior, who became an important influence in his life and work. The two men never became lovers but remained firm friends. In White's own words, \"He became what I most needed, an intellectual and aesthetic mentor\". They had many similarities: they were both gay and they both felt like outsiders in their own families; as a result they both had ambivalent feelings about their families and backgrounds, yet both maintained close and lifelong links with their families, particularly their mothers. They also both appreciated the benefits of social standing and connections and Christian symbolism and biblical themes are common in both artists' work.\nWhite dedicated his first novel  to De Maistre and acknowledged De Maistre's influence on his writing. In 1947, De Maistre's painting  was used as the cover for the first edition of White's . White bought many of De Maistre's paintings. In 1974 White gave all his paintings by De Maistre to the .\nTowards the end of the 1930s, White spent time in the United States, including , Massachusetts, and , which were artistic hotbeds at the time, where he wrote . By the time World War II broke out, he had returned to London and joined the British . He was accepted as an intelligence officer, and was posted to the Middle East. He served in Egypt, Palestine, and Greece before the war was over. While in the Middle East, he had an affair with a Greek army officer, , who was to become his life partner.\nWhite and Lascaris lived together in Cairo for six years before moving to a small farm purchased by White at , near Sydney, in 1948. After the death of White's mother in 1963, they moved into a large house, , in , where they lived for the rest of their lives.\nAfter the war, White once again returned to Australia, buying an old house in , now a Sydney suburb but then semi-rural. He named the house \"The Dogwoods,\" after trees he planted there. In this house, he settled down with Lascaris, the Greek he had met during the war. They lived there for 18 years, selling flowers, vegetables, milk, and cream as well as pedigreed puppies. During these years he started to make a reputation for himself as a writer, publishing  and  in the United States in 1955 and shortly after in the United Kingdom.  was released to rave reviews in the United States, but in what had become a typical pattern, it was panned in Australia. White had doubts about whether to continue writing after his books were largely dismissed in Australia (three of them having been called 'un-Australian' by critics), but, in the end, he decided to persevere. His first breakthrough in Australia came when his next novel, , won the inaugural .\nIn 1961, White published . It was to become both a bestseller and a prizewinner, gaining him a second Miles Franklin Award. In 1963, White and Lascaris decided to sell the house at Castle Hill. A number of White's works from the 1960s depict the fictional town of Sarsaparilla, including his collection of short stories, , and the play, . By now, he had clearly established his reputation as one of the world's great authors, but remained an essentially private person, resisting opportunities for interviews and public appearances although his circle of friends had widened significantly.\nIn 1968, White wrote , a searing character portrait of an artist. Many people drew links to the Sydney painter  (1904\u201384) and White's friend, the painter , but White denied the connections. Patrick White was an art collector who had, as a young man, been deeply impressed by his friends  and , and later said he wished he had been an artist.  By the mid-1960s, he had also become interested in encouraging dozens of young and less established artists, such as , , and . White was later friends with , the young star of Australian painting, in the 1970s. That friendship ended when White felt that Whiteley, a heroin addict, was deceitful and pushy about selling his paintings. A portrait of White by  won the 1962 .\nWhite decided not to accept any more prizes for his work, and he declined both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by  to work on a screenplay for  but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia's decision to participate in the . His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the , but in 1971, after losing to , he wrote to a friend: .\nNevertheless, in 1973, White did accept the Nobel Prize \"for an epic and psychological narrative art, which has introduced a new continent into literature\". His cause was said to have been championed by a Scandinavian diplomat resident in Australia. White enlisted Nolan to travel to Stockholm to accept the prize on his behalf. The award had an immediate impact on his career, as his publisher doubled the print run for  and gave him a larger advance for his next novel. White used the money from the prize to establish a trust to fund the , given annually to established creative writers who have received little public recognition. He was invited by the  to be seated on the floor of the House in recognition of his achievement. White declined, explaining that his nature could not easily adapt itself to such a situation. The last time such an invitation had been extended was in 1928, to .\nWhite was made  for 1974, but in a typically rebellious fashion, his acceptance speech encouraged Australians to spend the day reflecting on the state of the country. Privately, he was less than enthusiastic about it. In a letter to Marshall Best on 27 January 1974, he wrote: \"Something terrible happened to me last week. There is an organisation which chooses an Australian of the Year, who has to appear at an official lunch in  on . This year I was picked on as they had run through all the swimmers, tennis players, yachtsmen\".\nWhite and Lascaris hosted many dinner parties at Highbury, their Centennial Park home, in a leafy part of the affluent Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. In , his biographer  portrays White as a genial host but one who easily fell out with friends.\nWhite supported the conservative, business oriented  until the election of 's  government and, following the , he became particularly , making a rare appearance on national television to broadcast his views on the matter. White also publicly expressed his admiration for the historian , satirist , and unionist .\nDuring the 1970s, White's health began to deteriorate: his teeth were crumbling, his eyesight was failing, and he had chronic lung problems - however, he also became a more openly political person, and began sometimes commenting on current issues. He was among the first group of Companions of the  in 1975 but resigned in June 1976 in protest at the dismissal of the Whitlam government in November 1975 by the Governor-General Sir . In 1979, his novel  was shortlisted for the , but White requested that it to be removed to give younger writers a chance to win. (The prize was won by , who ironically was just four years younger than White.) Soon after, White announced that he had written his last novel, and from then on, he would write only for radio or the stage.\nDirector  introduced himself to White while walking down a Sydney street, some time after White had seen a politically loaded stage revue by Sharman, , which had been panned by Sydney newspaper critics, and had written a letter to the editor of a newspaper defending the show. White felt somewhat cautious at first, not least due to the gulf in age between them, but after a while the two men became friends and Sharman and his theatrical circle, as well as his visual style as a director, would inspire White to a couple of new plays, notably  with its satirical portrayal of a posh and vulgar upper-class Sydney society. A few years later, Sharman asked White if he could make a film of . White agreed and wrote the screenplay for the film.\nIn 1981, White published his autobiography, , which explored issues about which he had publicly said little such as his homosexuality, his dislike of the \"subservient\" attitude of Australian society towards Britain and the Royal family, and also the distance he had felt towards his mother. On , 1982, White addressed a crowd of 30,000 people, calling for a ban on  and for the destruction of .\nIn 1986 White released one last novel, , but it was published under the pen name \"Alex Xenophon Demirjian Gray\" with White named as editor.

White refused to see it when it was first performed at the , because  had been invited, and chose instead to see it later in Sydney. In 1987, White wrote , with his musings on ageing and society's efforts to achieve aesthetic perfection. When David Marr finished his biography of White in July 1990, his subject spent nine days going over the details with him.\nWhite died in Sydney on 30 September 1990.\nIn 2009, The Sydney Theatre Company staged White's play . In 2010 White received posthumous recognition for his novel , which was shortlisted for the  for 1970.\nIn 2011 Fred Schepisi's  of  was released with screenplay adaptation by ,  playing the son Basil,  as the daughter Dorothy, and  as the dying matriarch Elizabeth Hunter. This is the first screen realisation of a White novel, fittingly the one that played a key role in the Swedish panel's choice of White as Nobel prize winner.\nIn 1970, White was offered a knighthood but declined it.\nBoth White and  were members of the first group of six people appointed  (AC) in the civil division, (now called the general division). The awards were announced in the 1975 Queen's Birthday Honours List.

At the time, there were no institutions or facilities at which a PhD in chemistry could be done in Australia.\nAfter his arrival at Oxford and during , Cornforth significantly influenced the work on , particularly in purifying and concentrating it. Penicillin is usually very unstable in its crude form; as a consequence of this, researchers at the time were building upon 's work on the drug.

This was standard practice for throat swabs where other organisms in the mouth rendered cultures as not useful after 2 days. Due to other hospital work, the lab technicians did not have time to immediately throw out the 31st test on the second day, and so it stayed from Thursday through to the Monday.

The team's observations were contrary to the then-current models, which predicted that the expansion of the universe should be slowing down, and when the preliminary results emerged Schmidt assumed it was an error and he spent the next six weeks trying to find the mistake. But there was no mistake: contrary to expectations, by monitoring the brightness and measuring the  of the , they discovered that these billion-year old exploding stars and their galaxies were accelerating away from our reference frame.

For this work, she was awarded the 2009 , sharing it with Greider and , becoming the first Australian woman Nobel laureate. She also worked in , and was controversially dismissed from the  Administration's .\n\nElizabeth Helen Blackburn, one of seven children, was born in , , on 26 November 1948 to parents who were both family physicians. Her family moved to the city of  when she was four, where she attended the Broadland House Church of England Girls' Grammar School (later amalgamated with ) until the age of sixteen. Upon her family's relocation to , she attended , and ultimately gained very high marks in the end-of-year final statewide matriculation exams. She went on to earn a  in 1970 and  in 1972, both from the  in the field of biochemistry. Blackburn then went to receive her  in 1975 from the , where she worked with Frederick Sanger developing methods to sequence DNA using RNA, as well as studying the bacteriophage . It was also here, the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge University, where Blackburn met her husband John Sedat. Blackburn's soon to be husband had taken a position at Yale, where she then decided to finish her postdoctoral. \u201cThus it was that love brought me to a most fortunate and influential choice: Joe Gall\u2019s lab at Yale.\u201d\nDuring her postdoctoral work at Yale, Blackburn was doing research on the protozoan  and noticed a repeating  at the end of the linear rDNA which varied in size Blackburn then noticed that this hexanucleotide at the end of the chromosome contained a TTAGGG sequence that was , and the terminal end of the chromosomes were palindromic. These characteristics allowed Blackburn and colleagues to conduct further research on the protozoan. Using the telomeric repeated end of , Blackburn and colleague Jack Szostak showed the unstable replicating plasmids of yeast were protected from degradation, proving that these sequences contained characteristics of telomeres. This research also proved the telomeric repeats of  were conserved evolutionarily between the species. Through this research, Blackburn and collaborators noticed the replication system for chromosomes was not likely to add to the lengthening of the telomere, and that the addition of these hexanucleotides to the chromosomes was likely due to the activity of an enzyme that is able to transfer specific functional groups. The proposition of a possible transferase-like enzyme led Blackburn and PhD student Carol W. Greider to the discovery of an enzyme with reverse transcriptase activity that was able to fill in the terminal ends of telomeres without leaving the chromosome incomplete and unable to divide without loss of the end of the chromosome. This 1985 discovery led to the purification of this enzyme in lab, showing the transferase-like enzyme contained both RNA and protein components. The RNA portion of the enzyme served as a template for adding the telomeric repeats to the incomplete telomere, and the protein added enzymatic function for the addition of these repeats.Through this breakthrough, the term \u201ctelomerase\u201d was given to the enzyme, solving the end-replication process that had troubled scientists at the time.\n works by adding base pairs to the overhang of DNA on the 3\u2019 end, extending the strand until DNA polymerase and an RNA primer can complete the complementary strand and successfully synthesize the double stranded DNA. Since DNA polymerase only synthesizes DNA in the leading strand direction, the shortening of the telomere results. Through their research, Blackburn and collaborators were able to show that the telomere is effectively replenished by the enzyme telomerase, which conserves cellular division by preventing the rapid loss of genetic information internal to the telomere, leading to cellular aging.\n\n\nOn January 1, 2016, Blackburn was interviewed about her studies, discovering telomerase, and her current research. When she was asked to recall the moment of telomerase discovery she stated:In 1978, Blackburn joined the faculty of the , in the Department of Molecular Biology. In 1990, she moved across the San Francisco Bay to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the  (UCSF), where she served as the Department Chair from 1993 to 1999 and was the Morris Herzstein Professor of Biology and Physiology at UCSF. Blackburn became a Professor Emeritus at UCSF at the end of 2015.\nBlackburn, co-founded the company Telomere Health which offers telomere length testing to the public, but later severed ties with the company.\nIn 2015, Elizabeth Blackburn was announced as the new President of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. \u201cFew scientists garner the kind of admiration and respect that Dr. Blackburn receives from her peers for her scientific accomplishments and her leadership, service and integrity,\u201d says Irwin M. Jacobs, chairman of Salk's Board of Trustees, on Blackburn's appointment as President of the Institute. \u201cHer deep insight as a scientist, her vision as a leader, and her warm personality will prove invaluable as she guides the Salk Institute on its continuing journey of discovery.\u201d \u00a0In 2017, she announced her plans to retire from the Salk Institute the following year.\nFor their research and contributions to the understanding of telomeres and the enzyme telomerase, Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider, and Jack Szostaks were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The substantial research on the effects of chromosomal protection from telomerase, and the impact this has on cellular division has been a revolutionary catalyst in the field of molecular biology. For example, the addition of telomerase to cells that do not possess this enzyme has shown to bypass the limit of cellular aging in those cells, thereby linking this enzyme to reduced cellular aging. The addition of telomerase, and the presence of the enzyme in cancer cells has been shown to provide an immunity mechanism for the cell in proliferating, linking the transferase activity to increased cellular growth and reduced sensitivity for cellular signalling. The importance of discovering this enzyme has since sent led her continued research at the University of California San Francisco, where she studies the effect of telomeres and telomerase activity on cellular aging.\nBlackburn was appointed a member of the  in 2002. She supported human embryonic cell research, in opposition to the Bush Administration. Her Council terms were terminated by  directive on 27 February 2004. Dr. Blackburn believes that she was dismissed from the Council due to her disapproval of the Bush administration's position against stem cell research. This was followed by expressions of outrage over her removal by many scientists, 170 of whom signed an open letter to the president maintaining that she was fired because of political opposition to her advice.\nScientists and ethicists at the time even went as far to say that Blackburn's removal was in violation of Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which \u201crequires balance on such advisory bodies\u201d\n\"There is a growing sense that scientific research\u2014which, after all, is defined by the quest for truth\u2014is being manipulated for political ends,\" wrote Blackburn. \"There is evidence that such manipulation is being achieved through the stacking of the membership of advisory bodies and through the delay and misrepresentation of their reports.\"\nBlackburn serves on the Science Advisory Board of the Regenerative Medicine Foundation formerly known as the Genetics Policy Institute.\nBlackburn's first book  (2017) was co-authored with  Dr. Elissa Epel of Aging, Metabolism, and Emotions (AME) Center at the UCSF Center for Health and Community. Blackburn comments on aging reversal and care for one's telomeres through lifestyle: managing chronic stress, exercising, eating better and getting enough sleep; telomere testing, plus cautions and advice. While studying telomeres and the replenishing enzyme, telomerase, Blackburn discovered a vital role played by these protective caps that revolved around one central idea: aging of cells. The book hones in on many of the effects that poor health can have on telomeres and telomerase activity. Since telomeres shorten with every division of a cell, replenishing these caps is essential to long term cell growth. Through research and data, Blackburn explained that people that lead stressful lives exhibit less telomerase functioning in the body, which leads to a decrease in the dividing capabilities of the cell. Once telomeres shorten drastically, the cells can no longer divide, meaning the tissues they replenish with every division would therefore die out, highlighting the aging mechanism in humans. To increase telomerase activity in people with stress-filled lives, Blackburn suggests moderate exercise, even 15 minutes a day, which has been proven to stimulate telomerase activity and replenish the telomere.\nBlackburn also states that unhappiness in lives also has an effect on the shortening of telomeres. In a study done on divorced couples, their telomere length was \"significantly shorter\" compared to couples in healthy relationships, and Blackburn states, \"There's an obvious stressor... we are intensely social beings.\" She suggests to include positivity into our daily lives to increase health as well. While increasing the amount of exercise, decreasing stress, tobacco use, and maintaining a balanced sleep schedule, Blackburn explains that our telomeres can be drastically maintained and prevented from rapid shortening, leading to a decrease in the aging process of our cells. Blackburn also tells the readers to be wary of clinical pills who proclaim to lengthen or telomeres and protect the body from aging. She says that these pills and creams have no scientific proof of being anti-aging supplements, and that the key to preserving our telomeres and stimulating telomerase activity comes from leading a healthy life.\nIn recent years Blackburn and her colleagues have been investigating the effect of stress on telomerase and telomeres with particular emphasis on  meditation. She is also one of several biologists (and one of two Nobel Prize laureates) in the 1995 science documentary . Studies suggest that chronic psychological stress may accelerate ageing at the cellular level. Intimate partner violence was found to shorten telomere length in formerly abused women versus never abused women, possibly causing poorer overall health and greater morbidity in abused women.\nAt the University of California San Francisco, Blackburn currently researches telomeres and telomerase in many organisms, from yeast to human cells. The lab is focused on telomere maintenance, and how this has an impact on cellular aging. Many chronic diseases have been associated with the improper maintenance of these telomeres, thereby effecting cellular division, cycling, and impaired growth. At the cutting edge of telomere research, the Blackburn lab currently investigates the impact of limited maintenance of telomeres in cells through altering the enzyme telomerase.\nBlackburns awards and honors include:\nBlackburn was elected:\nIn 2007, Blackburn was listed among 's \nBlackburn splits her time living between La Jolla and  with her husband, scientist John W. Sedat, whom she met while at Cambridge, and has a son, Benjamin. In her personal life, Blackburn serves as a mentor and advocate for scientific research and policy, influencing generations to come to continue the research and work that she has initiated.\n"},

He married the daughter of president . Saavedra Lamas achieved renown not only as foreign minister of Argentina for his practical work in drafting international agreements and in conducting international mediation, but also as a professor for his scholarship in the fields of labor legislation and international law.\nSaavedra Lamas was a distinguished student at Lacordaire College and at the  where he received the Doctor of Laws degree in 1903, . After study in Paris and travel abroad, he accepted a professorship in law and constitutional history at the , where he began the teaching career that was to span more than forty years. Later, he inaugurated a course in sociology at the University of Buenos Aires, taught political economy and constitutional law in the Law School of the university, and eventually served as the president of the university.\nSaavedra Lamas was a leading Argentine academician in two areas. A pioneer in the field of labor legislation, he edited several treatises on labor legislation in Argentina and on the need for a universally recognized doctrine on the treatment of labor - among them, Centro de legislac\u00edon social y del trabajo (1927) [Center of Social and Labor Legislation], Trait\u00e9s internationaux de type social (1924), C\u00f3digo nacional del trabajo (three volumes, 1933) [National Code of Labor Law]. In the arena of practical affairs, Saavedra Lamas drafted legislation affecting labor in Argentina, supported the founding of the International Labor Organization in 1919, and presided over the ILO Conference of 1928 in Geneva while serving simultaneously as leader of the Argentine delegation.\nIn international law, his other field of major scholarly interest, he published \"La Crise de la codification et de la doctrine Argentine de droit international\" (1931); and he spoke, wrote, or drafted legislation on many subjects with international ramifications - among them, asylum, colonization, immigration, arbitration, and international peace. His brief Vida internacional, which he wrote at the age of seventy, is an urbane by-product of all this study and experience.\nSaavedra Lamas began his political career in 1906 as director of Public Credit and then became the secretary-general for the municipality of Buenos Aires in 1907. In 1908 he was elected to the first of two successive terms in Parliament. There he initiated legislation regarding coastal water rights, irrigation, sugar production, government finances, colonization, and immigration. His main interest, however, lay in foreign affairs. He provided leadership in saving Argentina's arbitration treaty with Italy, which almost foundered in 1907-1908, and eventually became the unofficial adviser to both the legislature and the foreign office on the analysis and implications of proposed foreign treaties. Saavedra Lamas though was also a controversial public figure as he was seen by the masses as an elitist patrician who was too conservative and favored British intervention, especially in railroad construction.\nAppointed minister of Justice and Education in 1915, he instituted educational reforms by integrating the different divisions of public education and by developing a curriculum at the intermediate level for the vocational and technical training of manpower needed in a developing industrial country.\nWhen General  became president of Argentina in 1932, he appointed Saavedra Lamas as foreign minister. In this post for six years, Saavedra Lamas brought international prestige to Argentina. He played an important role in every South American diplomatic issue of the middle thirties, induced Argentina to rejoin the League of Nations after an absence of thirteen years, and represented Argentina at virtually every international meeting of consequence during this period.\nHis work in ending the  between Paraguay and Bolivia (1932\u20131935) had not only local significance but generalized international importance as well. When he took over the foreign office, he immediately engaged in a series of moves to lay the diplomatic groundwork for a negotiated settlement of this dispute. In 1932 he initiated at Washington the Declaration of August 3 which put the American states on record as refusing to recognize any territorial change in the hemisphere brought about by force. Next, he drew up a Treaty of Nonaggression and Conciliation which was signed by six South American countries in October, 1933, and by all of the American countries at the Seventh Pan-American Conference at Montevideo two months later. In 1935 he organized mediation by six neutral American nations which resulted in the cessation of hostilities between Paraguay and Bolivia. Meanwhile, in 1934, Saavedra Lamas presented the South American Antiwar Pact to the League of Nations where it was well received and signed by eleven countries. Acclaimed for all of these efforts, he was elected president of the Assembly of the League of Nations in 1936.\nAfter his retirement from the foreign ministry in 1938, Saavedra Lamas returned to academic life, became president of the University of Buenos Aires for two years (1941\u20131943), and rounded out his career as a professor for an additional three years (1943\u20131946).\nSaavedra Lamas was known as a strict disciplinarian in his office, a logician at the conference table, a charming host in his home or his art gallery, and a man of sartorial elegance who wore, it is said, the highest collars in Buenos Aires. In addition to the , he was awarded the  and analogous honors from ten other countries.\nHe died in 1959 at the age of eighty from the effects of a brain hemorrhage.\nIn March 2014 his solid gold Nobel medal was put up for auction after being found in a South American pawn shop.\nIn August 2014 a project for rebuying his Nobel medal by the Argentine Nation was presented at the Argentine congress. His auctioned medal was later won and is now owned by a private Asian collector.\n\n"},

Luis Leloir is buried in , .\nLeloir's parents, Federico Augusto Rufino Leloir Bernal and Hortensia Aguirre de Leloir, traveled from Buenos Aires to Paris in the middle of 1906 with the intention of treating Federico's illness. However, Federico died in late August, and a week later Luis was born in an old house at 81 V\u00edctor Hugo Road in Paris, a few blocks away from the .

His education was divided between Escuela General San Mart\u00edn (primary school),  (secondary school), and for a few months at  in . His grades were unspectacular, and his first stint in college ended quickly when he abandoned his architectural studies that he had begun in Paris' .\nIt was during the 1920s that Leloir invented  (golf sauce). After being served prawns with the usual sauce during lunch with a group of friends at the Ocean Club in Mar del Plata, Leloir came up with a peculiar combination of ketchup and mayonnaise to spice up his meal. With the financial difficulties that later plagued Leloir's laboratories and research, he would joke, \"If I had patented that sauce, we'd have a lot more money for research right now.\"\nAfter returning again to , Leloir obtained his Argentine citizenship and joined the Department of Medicine at the  in hopes of receiving his doctorate. However, he got off to a rocky start, requiring four attempts to pass his anatomy exam. He finally received his diploma in 1932 and began his residency in the  and his medical internship in Ramos Mej\u00eda hospital. After some initial conflicts with colleagues and complications in his method of treating patients, Leloir decided to dedicate himself to research in the laboratory, claiming that \"we could do little for our patients... antibiotics, psychoactive d, and all the new therapeutic agents were unknown [at the time].\"\nIn 1933, he met , who pointed Leloir towards investigating in his doctoral thesis the  and carbohydrate metabolism. Houssay happened to be friends with , the brother-in-law of , one of Leloir's cousins. Following the recommendation of Udaondo, Leloir began working with Houssay, who in 1947 would later win the . The two would develop a close relationship, collaborating on various projects until Houssay's death in 1971; in his lecture after winning the Nobel Prize, Leloir claimed that his \"whole research career has been influenced by one person, Prof. Bernardo A. Houssay\".\nAfter only two years, Leloir received recognition from the medical department at UBA for having produced the best doctoral thesis. Feeling that his knowledge in fields such as , , , and  was lacking, he continued attending classes at the University as a part-time student. In 1936 he traveled to England to begin advanced studies at the , under the supervision of another Nobel Prize winner, Sir , who had obtained that distinction in 1929 for his work in  and in revealing the critical role of  in maintaining good health. Leloir's research in the Biochemical Laboratory of Cambridge centered around , more specifically the effects of  and  on succinic dehydrogenase; from this moment Leloir began to specialize in researching carbohydrate metabolism.\nLeloir returned to Buenos Aires in 1937 after his brief stay at Cambridge. 1943 saw Leloir marry; Luis Leloir and Amelia Zuberbuhler (1920-2013) would later have a daughter also named Amelia. However, his return to Argentina was amidst conflict and strife;  Houssay had been expelled from the University of Buenos Aires for signing a public petition opposing the  regime in  and the military government led  by . Leloir fled to the , where he assumed the position of associate professor in the Department of  at , collaborating with  and  and thereafter worked with  at the College of Physicians and Surgeons,  as a research assistant. Leloir would later credit Green with instilling within him the initiative to establish his own research in Argentina.\nIn 1945, Leloir ended his exile and returned to Argentina to work under Houssay at the , which Leloir would direct from its creation in 1947 by businessman and patron . Initially, the institute was composed of five rooms, a bathroom, central hall, patio, kitchen, and changing room.

M. Mu\u00f1oz, he produced an active cell-free system, a first in scientific research. It had initially been assumed that in order to study a cell, scientists could not separate it from its host organism, as oxidation could only occur in intact cells. Along the way, Mu\u00f1oz and Leloir, unable to procure the costly centrifuge needed to separate cell contents, improvised by spinning a tire stuffed with salt and ice.\nBy 1947 he had formed a team that included \nCaputto, Enrico Cabib, Ra\u00fal Trucco, Alejandro Paladini, Carlos Cardini and Jos\u00e9 Luis Reissig, with whom he investigated and discovered why a malfunctioning kidney and  helped cause . That same year,  his colleague , in his investigations of the , made discoveries regarding carbohydrate storage and its subsequent transformation into a reserve energy form in organisms.\nAt the beginning of 1948, Leloir and his team identified the sugar nucleotides that were fundamental to the metabolism of carbohydrates, turning the Instituto Campomar into a biochemistry institution well known throughout the world. Immediately thereafter, Leloir received the Argentine Scientific Society Prize,  one of the many awards he would receive both in Argentina and internationally. During this time, his team dedicated itself to the study of ; Leloir and his colleagues elucidated the primary mechanisms of galactose metabolism (now coined the ) and determined the cause of galactosemia, a serious  that resulted in .\nThe following year, he reached an agreement with Rolando Garc\u00eda, dean of the  at UBA, which named Leloir, Carlos Eugenio Cardini and Enrico Cabib as titular professors in the University's newly founded Biochemical Institute. The Institute would help develop scientific programs in budding Argentine universities as well as attract researchers and scholars from the United States, , England, France, Spain, and other Latin American countries.\nFollowing Campomar's death in 1957, Leloir and his team applied to the  in the United States desperate for funding, and surprisingly was accepted. In 1958, the Institute found a new home in a former all-girls school, a donation from the Argentine government. As Leloir and his research gained greater prominence, further research came from the Argentine Research Council, and the Institute would later become associated with the University of Buenos Aires.\nAs his work in the laboratory was coming to an end, Leloir continued his teaching position in the Department of Natural Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires, taking a hiatus only to complete his studies at Cambridge and at the Enzyme Research Laboratory in the United States.\nIn 1983, Leloir became one of the founding members of the Third World Academy of Sciences, later renamed the .\nOn December 2, 1970, Leloir received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry from the King of  for his discovery of the  in , becoming only the third Argentine to receive the prestigious honor in any field. In his acceptance speech at , he borrowed from 's famous 1940 speech to the  and remarked, \"never have I received so much for so little\". Leloir and his team reportedly celebrated by drinking champagne from test tubes, a rare departure from the humility and frugality that characterized the atmosphere of Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Campomar under Leloir's direction. The $80,000 prize money was spent directly on research, and when asked about the significance of his achievement, Leloir responded:\nLeloir published a short autobiography, entitled \"Long Ago and Far Away\" in the 1983 . The title, Leloir claims, is derived from one of 's novels that depicted the country wildlife and scenery of Leloir's childhood.\nHe died in Buenos Aires December 2, 1987, of a heart attack soon after returning to his home from the laboratory, and is buried in . , a friend and colleague of Leloir, claims that his lasting legacy was proving that \"scientific research on an international level, although precarious, was possible in an underdeveloped country in the middle of political strife\" and credits Leloir's vigilance and will for his ultimate success. With his research in dire financial straits, Leloir often resorted to homemade gadgets and contraptions to continue his work in the laboratory. In one instance, Leloir reportedly used waterproof cardboard to create makeshift gutters in order to protect his laboratory's library from the rain.\nLeloir was known for his humility, focus and consistency, described by many as a \"true monk in science\". Every morning his wife Amelia would drive him in their  and drop him off at 1719 Juli\u00e1n Alvarez Street, location of Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Campomar, with Leloir wearing the same worn out, gray overalls. He worked sitting on the same straw seat for decades and encouraged colleagues to eat lunch in the laboratory to save time, bringing enough meat stew to share with everyone. Indeed, despite Leloir's frugality and extreme dedication to his research, he was a sociable man, claiming not to like working alone.\nThe Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Campomar has since been renamed , and has grown to become a 21,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (2,000\u00a0m) building with 20 senior researchers, 42 technicians and administrative personnel, 8 post doctorate fellows, and 20 Ph.D. candidates.

His parents were M\u00e1xima (Vapniarsky) and L\u00e1zaro Milstein, a  immigrant. He graduated from the  and obtained a PhD under Professor Stoppani (Professor of ). Thereafter, he was a member of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, England, and held dual Argentine and British citizenship. In 1956, he received an award from the Sociedad Bioqu\u00edmica Argentina for his work on  with the  aldehyde dehydrogenase. In 1958, funded by the , he joined the  Department at the  at  to work for a PhD under  on the mechanism of metal activation of the enzyme . During this work, he collaborated with  whose group he joined with a short-term  appointment.\nThe major part of Milstein's research career was devoted to studying the structure of antibodies and the mechanism by which antibody diversity is generated. It was as part of this quest that, in 1975, he worked with  (a postdoctoral fellow in his laboratory) to develop the  technique for the production of \u2014a discovery recognized by the award of the 1984 . This discovery led to an enormous expansion in the exploitation of antibodies in science and medicine.\nMilstein himself made many major contributions to improvements and developments in monoclonal antibody technology\u2014especially in the use of  to provide markers that allow distinction between different cell types. In collaboration with Claudio Cuello, Milstein helped lay the foundation for the use of monoclonal antibodies as probes for the investigation of the pathological pathways in neurological disorders as well as many other diseases. Milstein and Cuello's work also enabled the use of monoclonal antibodies to enhance the power of immuno-based diagnostic tests. In addition, Milstein foresaw the potential wealth of ligand-binding reagents that could result from applying recombinant  technology to monoclonal antibodies and inspired the development of the field of antibody engineering which was to lead to safer and more powerful monoclonal antibodies for use as therapeutics.\nMilstein's early work on antibodies focused on their diversity at the amino acid level, as well as on the disulfide bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies, where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted  that contained a signal sequence. The development of the  technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of  of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody . In this process, localized mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved , which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in recent years was devoted to characterizing this mutational process, with a view to understanding its mechanism. He contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.\nQuite apart from his own achievements, Milstein acted as a guide and inspiration to many in the antibody field, as well as devoting himself to assisting science and scientists in less developed countries. It is also worth mentioning, that even though the Nobel Prize would have made him a wealthy man, Milstein did not patent his enormous discovery since he believed that it was mankind's intellectual property. According to his beliefs, his work did not have any economic interest, only scientific.\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize 1984, Milstein was elected a , was a fellow of  from 1980 to 2002, awarded the  from  in 1980, won the  in 1989, and became a  in 1995.

However, the researchers did not have enough penicillin to help him to a full recovery, and he relapsed and died. Because of this experience and the difficulty in producing penicillin, the researchers changed their focus to children, who could be treated with smaller quantities of penicillin.\nFlorey's research team investigated the large-scale production of the mould and efficient extraction of the active ingredient, succeeding to the point where, by 1945, penicillin production was an industrial process for the Allies in World War II.

Aged 17, he was awarded a senior scholarship to study medicine at the . As a medical undergraduate, he was never able to find a satisfactory explanation for the interaction of mind and body; he started to think about becoming a neuroscientist. He graduated (with first class honours) in 1925, and was awarded a  to study under  at , , where he received his Doctor of Philosophy in 1929.\nIn 1937 Eccles returned to Australia, where he worked on military research during . During this time Eccles was the director of Kanematsu Institute at , he and  gave research lectures at the , strongly influencing its intellectual environment. After the war, he became a professor at the  in New Zealand. From 1952 to 1962 he worked as a professor at the  (JCSMR) of the . The Eccles Institute of Neuroscience is headquartered in a new wing of the JCSMR building, constructed with the assistance of a $63M grant from the Commonwealth Government and completed in March 2012.\nIn the early 1950s, Eccles and his colleagues performed the research that would lead to his receiving the Nobel Prize. To study synapses in the peripheral nervous system, Eccles and colleagues used the stretch reflex as a model, which is easily studied because it consists of only two : a sensory neuron (the  fibre) and the . The sensory neuron synapses onto the motor neuron in the . When a current is passed into the sensory neuron in the , the motor neuron innervating the quadriceps produced a small  (EPSP). When a similar current is passed through the , the opposing muscle to the quadriceps, an  (IPSP) is produced in the quadriceps motor neuron. Although a single EPSP was not enough to fire an  in the motor neuron, the sum of several EPSPs from multiple sensory neurons synapsing onto the motor neuron can cause the motor neuron to fire, thus contracting the quadriceps. On the other hand, IPSPs could subtract from this sum of EPSPs, preventing the motor neuron from firing.\nApart from these seminal experiments, Eccles was key to a number of important developments in . Until around 1949, Eccles believed that  was primarily electrical rather than chemical.

He died in 1997 in , , Switzerland.\nIn  (1973), Eccles summarises his philosophy: \"Now before discussing brain function in detail I will at the beginning give an account of my philosophical position on the so-called 'brain-mind problem' so that you will be able to relate the experimental evidence to this philosophical position. I have written at length on this philosophy in my book . In Fig. 6-1 you will be able to see that I fully accept the recent philosophical achievements of  with his concept of three worlds. I was a , now I am a ! Cartesian dualism has become unfashionable with many people. They embrace  to escape the enigma of brain-mind interaction with its perplexing problems. But Sir Karl Popper and I are , and what is more, ! The three worlds are very easily defined. I believe that in the classification of Fig. 6-1 there is nothing left out. It takes care of everything that is in existence and in our experience. All can be classified in one or other of the categories enumerated under Worlds 1, 2 and 3.\n\n\"In Fig. 6-1, World 1 is the world of physical objects and states. It comprises the whole cosmos of matter and energy, all of biology including human brains, and all artifacts that man has made for coding information, as for example, the paper and ink of books or the material base of works of art. World 1 is the total world of the materialists. They recognise nothing else. All else is fantasy.\n\"World 2 is the world of states of consciousness and subjective knowledge of all kinds. The totality of our perceptions comes in this world. But there are several levels. In agreement with Polten, I tend to recognise three kinds of levels of World 2, as indicated in Fig. 6-2, but it may be more correct to think of it as a spectrum.\nFIG. 6-2, World of Consciousness\n\"The first level (outer sense) would be the ordinary perceptions provided by all our sense organs, hearing and touch and sight and smell and pain. All of these perceptions are in World 2, of course: vision with light and colour; sound with music and harmony; touch with all its qualities and vibration; the range of odours and tastes, and so on. These qualities do not exist in World 1, where correspondingly there are but electromagnetic waves, pressure waves in the atmosphere, material objects, and chemical substances.\n\"In addition there is a level of , which is the world of more subtle perceptions. It is the world of your emotions, of your feelings of joy and sadness and fear and anger and so on. It includes all your memory, and all your imaginings and planning into the future. In fact there is a whole range of levels which could be described at length. All the subtle experiences of the human person are in this inner sensory world. It is all private to you but you can reveal it in linguistic expression, and by gestures of all levels of subtlety.\n\"Finally, at the core of World 2 there is the  or , which is the basis of our unity as an experiencing being throughout our whole lifetime.\n\"This World 2 is our . Our conscious experiences are the basis of our knowledge of World 1, which is thus a world of , a derivative world. Whenever I am doing a scientific experiment, for example, I have to plan it cognitively, all in my thoughts, and then consciously carry out my plan of action in the experiment. Finally I have to look at the results and evaluate them in thought. For example, I have to see the traces of the oscilloscope and their photographic records or hear the signals on the loudspeaker.

Throughout his career he played an active role in the development of public policy for the medical sciences in Australia and was a founding member of the  (AAS), and served as its president from 1965 to 1969.\nBurnet's major achievements in microbiology included discovering the causative agents of  and ; developing  for the isolation, culture and detection of ; describing the recombination of influenza ; demonstrating that the  virus does not cause disease in humans. Modern methods for producing  are still based on Burnet's work improving virus growing processes in .\nBurnet was the most highly decorated and honoured scientist to have worked in Australia. For his contributions to Australian science, he was made the first  in 1960, and in 1978 a Knight of the . He was recognised internationally for his achievements: in addition to the Nobel, he received the  and the  and  from the , honorary doctorates, and distinguished service honours from the  and Japan.\nBurnet was born in , ; his father, Frank Burnet, a Scottish emigrant to Australia, was the manager of the Traralgon branch of the Colonial Bank. His mother Hadassah Burnet (n\u00e9e Mackay) was the daughter of a middle-class Scottish immigrant, and met his father when Frank was working in the town of . Frank was 36, and 14 years older than Hadassah. The family was socially conservative Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Frank Macfarlane Burnet was the second of seven children and from childhood was known as \"Mac\". He had an older sister, two younger sisters and three younger brothers. The eldest daughter Doris had a mental disability that consumed most of Hadassah's time and the family saw Doris's condition as an unspoken stigma, discouraging the other children from inviting friends home, lest they come across the eldest daughter. From his early years in Traralgon, Mac enjoyed exploring the environment around him, particularly Traralgon Creek. He first attended a private school run by a single teacher before starting at the government primary school at the age of 7. Mac was distant from his father\u2014who liked to spend his free time fishing and playing golf\u2014from a young age. He preferred bookish pursuits from a young age and was not enamoured of sport, and by the age of eight was old enough to analyse his father's character; Mac disapproved of Frank and saw him as a hypocrite who espoused moral principles and put on a facade of uprightedness, while associating with businessmen of dubious ethics. Hadassah was preoccupied with Doris, so Mac developed a rather solitary personality.\nThe Burnets moved to  in 1909, when Frank was posted to be the bank manager there, having declined a post in London. Burnet was interested in the wildlife around the nearby ; he joined the  in 1910 and enjoyed all outdoor activities. While living in Terang, he began to collect  and study biology. He read biology articles in the , which introduced him to the work of . During his early teens, the family took annual holidays to , where Burnet spent his time observing and recording the behaviour of the wildlife. He was educated at Terang State School and attended Sunday school at the local church, where the priest encouraged him to pursue scholastic studies and awarded him a book on ants as a reward for his academic performance. He advised Frank to invest in Mac's education and he won a full scholarship to board and study at , one of Victoria's most exclusive private schools. Starting there in 1913, Burnet was the only boarder with a full scholarship. He did not enjoy his time there among the scions of the ruling upper class; while most of his peers were brash and sports-oriented, Burnet was bookish and not athletically inclined, and found his fellow students to be arrogant and boorish. During this period he kept his beetle-collecting and disapproval of his peers a secret and mixed with his schoolmates out of necessity. Nevertheless, his academic prowess gained him privileges, and he graduated in 1916, placing first in his school overall, and in history, English, chemistry and physics. The typical university path for a person of his social background was to pursue studies in theology, law or medicine. By this time, he was becoming disillusioned with religion and chose medicine. Due to World War I, military service was a possibility and he felt that a medical background would increase his chances of being given a non-combat post.\nFrom 1918, Burnet attended the , where he lived in  on a residential scholarship. There, he read more of Darwin's work and was influenced by the ideas of science and society in the writings of . He enjoyed his time at university and spent much of his free time reading biology books in the library to feed his passion for scientific knowledge. He also had fleeting sporting success, holding down a position in Ormond's First VIII rowing squad for a brief period. He continued to pursue his study of beetles in private, although his classmates found out and there was no loss in this as they viewed his hobby positively. Despite an ongoing shyness, Burnet got on well with staff and students at university. Burnet was self-motivated and often skipped lectures to study at his own faster pace and pursue further knowledge in the library, and he came equal first in physics and chemistry in first year. The following year, 1918, he became increasingly immersed in laboratory work, but he was also dogged by peer pressure to enlist in the , which he saw as a distasteful prospect. However, this was averted by the end of the . In 1919, he was one of 12 high-performing students selected for extra tuition, and he came equal first in third year physiology. He began clinical work in the same year, but found it somewhat unpleasant as he was interested in diagnosing the patient and had little interest in showing empathy towards them.\nWhile at university, he became an  and later an aggressive atheist; he was sceptical of religious faith, which he regarded as \"an effort to believe what common sense tells you isn't true.\" He was also disgusted by what he regarded as hypocritical conduct by religious adherents. Towards the later years of his undergraduate years, his unhappiness with religion began to dog him to a greater extent. He tried to become involved with  for a brief period but then resolved to devote himself to scientific research. The length of time required to study medicine had been reduced to five years to train doctors faster following the outbreak of , and Burnet graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and a Bachelor of Surgery in 1922, ranking second in the final exams despite the death of his father a few weeks earlier. His fellow graduates included , , , Rupert Willis and , who became distinguished scientists in their own right.\nHe then did a ten-month residency at  to gain experience before going into practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under  and , both well known surgeons. He enjoyed this period immensely and was disappointed when he had to do his medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist , whom Burnet came to idolise. As a result of this he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the  was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, who was in charge of such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more suited to a laboratory research career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. Burnet complied.\nDuring the transition period he worked as a pathology registrar at the  and also prepared for his Doctor of Medicine examinations, late in 1923. In 1923 he took up the post of senior resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital; the laboratories were a part of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He conducted research into the  reactions in , leading to his first scientific publications. He decided to work full-time on the  response in , even though he was technically supposed to pursuing  as part of his obligations to the hospital. Burnet came first in the Doctor of Medicine exams by a long distance, and his score was excluded from the scaling process so that the other students would not fail for being so far behind.\nAt the time, the Hall Institute was in the early stages of rapid expansion. The new director of the Institute, , wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in ,  and  that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to Burnet and saw him as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on  in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the  at the  in . Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was free to do his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if  was affected by .\nHe was awarded the  by the Lister Institute in 1926; this gave him enough money for him to resign his curator position and he began full-time research on bacteriophages. He injected mice with bacteriophage and observed their immunological reactions and believed bacteriophages to be . For this work he received a Ph.D. from the  in 1928 under the direction of Professor  and was invited to write a chapter on bacteriophages for the  . He was also given an invitation to deliver a paper at the  in 1927 on the link between O-agglutinins and bacteriophage. Burnet began attending the  functions and befriended some communists, although he refrained from joining them in overt left-wing activism. He also spent his free time enjoying theatre, engaging in amateur  and cycling through continental Europe.\nWhile in London, Burnet became engaged to fellow Australian Edith Linda Marston Druce. She was a secondary school teacher and daughter of a barrister's clerk and the pair had met in 1923 and had a few dates but did not keep in touch. Druce sought out Burnet while on a holiday in London and they quickly agreed to marriage although she had to return to Australia. They married in 1928 after he had completed his Ph.D. and returned to Australia, and had a son and two daughters. At the time, there was a vacancy for the Chair of Bacteriology at the University of London, and Ledingham was lobbying his colleagues to offer Burnet the post, but Burnet returned to Australia, partly because of Druce.\nWhen Burnet returned to Australia, he went back to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, where he was appointed assistant director by Kellaway. His first assignment was to investigate the \"Bundaberg disaster\", in which 12 children had died after receiving a contaminated  vaccine. Kellaway was put in charge of a  to investigate the matter and he put Burnet in charge of the laboratory investigations. He identified  in the toxin- mixture that had been administered to the children; it had been picked up from the skin of one of the children and then transmitted to the others in the injections. However, it turned out to be another toxin that had caused the children's deaths; this work on staphylococcal toxin piqued his interest in immunology. During this time, he continued to study bacteriophages, writing 32 papers on phages between 1924 and 1937. In 1929, Burnet and his graduate assistant Margot McKie wrote a paper suggesting that bacteriophages could exist as a stable non-infectious form that multiplies with the bacterial host. Their pioneering description of  was not accepted until much later, and was crucial to the work of ,  and  on the replication mechanism and genetics of viruses, for which they were awarded the 1969 .\nBetween 1932 and 1933, Burnet took leave of absence to undertake a fellowship at the  in London. The Great Depression had resulted in Burnet's salary being cut from 1000 to 750 pounds, and the National Institute had been given a large grant from the  that allowed them to hire Burnet at 1000 pounds per annum. The National Institute's Director Sir  gained permission from Kellaway for the two-year move; Kellaway promised to hold Burnet's job for him when he returned and felt that the experience would make Burnet\u2014whom he saw as the Hall Institute's brightest young scientist\u2014better equipped to expand operations when he returned to Melbourne. Dale also paid for Burnet's sister to travel to England to help look after her brother's young children.\nSignificant breakthroughs in virology were made while he was there, including the isolation and first demonstration of the transmission of the  virus. His own research was on the , which he used in developing a chick embryo assay for the isolation and quantification of animal viruses. Dale offered Burnet a permanent position but he declined and returned to the Hall Institute. Following his productive work in London, the Rockefeller Institute agreed to fund a new virus research laboratory in Melbourne for Burnet. He brought back a set of viruses from the National Institute to begin the basis of research in Melbourne.\nWhen Burnet returned to Australia, he continued his work on virology, including the  of . He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of  and . After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban in order to prevent human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist , the causative organism of which was named  in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of herpes and Q fever displayed an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his scientific method.\nDuring World War II, Burnet's research moved to  and . With the outbreak of war, Burnet was handed more responsibility and made acting director and had to oversee the move into a new building as Kellaway was seconded to the military in 1939. Due to Kellaway, many of the infectious disease problems afflicting the military were referred to the Institute. Fearing a repeat of the massive global influenza outbreak that occurred after World War I, Burnet focused the Institute in the search for a vaccine. He first tested the vaccine on a group of medical students, and after a promising test on 107 army volunteers in February 1942 following a rise in infections, a large-scale program was introduced two months later to inoculate all new recruits after an influenza A outbreak. In this trial, 20,000 personnel were vaccinated, without success, and the scheme was abandoned. In 1942, the investigations into scrub typhus accelerated after an exodus of researchers in that field from  after the  conquest of the area. However, this ended in tragedy when his collaborator  accidentally injected herself and then died of the infection. Nevertheless, his work on immunisation had earned him international recognition by this time.\nBurnet's first book, , was published in 1940. It had wide influence and was translated into several languages. In 1942 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1944 he travelled to  to deliver the Dunham Lectures. There he was offered a chair, but he refused and returned to Australia. This was attributed to his nationalistic tendencies, as well as his sense of loyalty to the Hall Institute. During his trip he also visited the US military facility at , where he discussed his work on influenza with the scientists working there.\nIn 1944, he was appointed director of the Institute when Kellaway was appointed director of the . Although Kellaway had groomed Burnet to become a pivotal figure, he was hesitant as to whether Burnet would be at his most effective with a strategic leadership role. Kellaway thought that Burnet might not be suited to the post, and should have continued to focus purely on research for the time being. Burnet had similar doubts, particularly given his taciturn nature, but applied for the position anyway. Although he was not known for his social skills, his ability as a scientist and to impart ideas for investigation to his subordinates held his leadership and the Institute in good stead. Unlike his predecessor, who valued a broad gamut of research activities, Burnet was of the opinion that the Institute could not make a significant impact at global level in this way, and he pursued a policy of focusing all effort into one area at a time. Always a strong-willed and rather isolated man, he became more single-minded and less tolerant of criticism of his work and expected a more hierarchical structure and unquestioning obedience. According to biographer Sexton, he \"displayed a kind of territorial protectiveness in relation to his own work\".\nIn 1944, it was decided by the University of Melbourne that Burnet would be appointed a professor as part of a cooperative program so that university students could be experimentally trained at the Institute, while the researchers engaged in some teaching. This was not a success, and there was much tension, as Burnet repeatedly expressed his opinion in public that university teaching and research should be kept separate, at one point leading to a series of open letters from university professors decrying his attitude. Burnet was also not interested in the politics of university funding, and his disengagement from administrative matters engendered resentment. On the other hand, Burnet was vigorous in obtaining funding for the Hall Institute from government bodies, resorting to the bluff of feigning interest in moving overseas to secure continued strong backing. However, he was criticised for being thrifty and refusing to invest in cutting edge equipment, despite the Hall Institute's high standing in research circles. Colleagues believed that he was sceptical of modern technology and thought his outlook to be limiting.\nIn 1946, he initiated the Clinical Research Unit to allow for closer cooperation with the clinical activities of the now named . Despite his known derisive views of clinical science as being inferior, he supported the work enthusiastically.\nUnder Burnet's direction, scientists at the Institute made significant contributions to infectious disease research during a period that has been called the \"golden age of virology\". Virologists including , , , , and  made significant contributions on , , , , herpes and influenza.\nBurnet made significant contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including  assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the  that is secreted by , which later provided the foundation for  significant work on  and the neuraminidase substrate, . Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.\nIn 1957, Burnet decided that research at the Institute should focus on immunology. Burnet reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned and feeling the action was arrogant; for Burnet's part he was comfortable with the decision as he thought it to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the 's . After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on immunological problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to  and the  reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of immunology, immunological surveillance and cancer.\nAt the time, immunology was becoming more sophisticated, with the increasing role of  and . Burnet was suspicious of the direction in which immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude was a factor in his decision to turn the Institute's focus to immunology.\nBurnet began to switch his focus to immunology in the 1940s. In 1941 he wrote a  called \"The Production of Antibodies\", which was revised and reissued in 1949 with Frank Fenner as a co-author. This book is seen as a key publication in immunology\u2014it marks the move from the study of immunology as a chemical endeavour to a biological one. Importantly in this work, he introduced the concept of \"self\" and \"non-self\" to immunology. The distinction between self and non-self was an integral part of Burnet's biological outlook, of his interest in the living organism in its totality, its activities, and interactions. Burnet regarded the \"self\" of the host body as being actively defined during its embryogenesis through complex interactions between immune cells and all the other cells and molecules within an embryo.\nUsing the concept of self, Burnet introduced a hypothesis about the situation where the body failed to make antibodies to its own components () and by extension the idea of . He proposed that\nBurnet was, however, unable to prove this experimentally. ,  and  did find support for Burnet's hypothesis in 1953 when they showed that  could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not from any other mouse strain. Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet and Medawar were able to coordinate their work effectively despite their rather different personalities and physical separation; Burnet was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.\nHowever, later studies showed that cells or tissues transplanted before the immune system development of the recipient, such as in embryonic recipients, could be treated as foreign and trigger rejection, countering Burnet's explanation for self tolerance. In contrast to the Burnet hypothesis of a special tolerance-inducing period defined by the age of the animal,  proposed in 1959, that it is the age of the lymphocyte that defines whether an antigen that is encountered will induce tolerance, with immature lymphocytes being tolerance-sensitive. Lederberg's concept is now known as central tolerance, and is widely accepted. It may also explain the success of some transplants given early in life and the failure to induce tolerance in other studies. Burnet noted that his contributions to immune tolerance were strictly theoretical:\nBurnet was interested in how the body produces antibodies in response to antigens. The dominant idea in the literature through the 1940s was that the antigen acted as a template for antibody production, which was known as the \"instructive\" hypothesis. Burnet was not satisfied with this explanation, and in the second edition of \"The Production of Antibodies\", he and Fenner advanced an indirect template theory which proposed that each antigen could influence the genome, thus effecting the production of antibodies. In 1956 he became interested in 's natural selection hypothesis, which described a mechanism for immune response based on an earlier theory of Nobel-winning immunologist . Jerne proposed that the antigen bound to an antibody by chance and, that upon binding, more antibodies to that antigen would be produced. Burnet developed a model which he named  that expanded on and improved Jerne's hypothesis. Burnet proposed that each  bears on its surface specific immunoglobulins reflecting the specificity of the antibody that will later be synthesised once the cell is activated by an antigen. The antigen serves as a selective stimulus, causing preferential proliferation and differentiation of\nthe clones that have receptors for that antigen.\nIn 1958  and Lederberg showed that one  always produces only one antibody, which was the first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book . His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and  as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.\nThere is some contention over Burnet's publication of his version of the theory in the  in 1957. Some commentators argue he published in an Australian journal to fast-track his hypothesis and obtain priority for his theory over ideas that were published later that year in a paper written by , which Burnet had read prior to its publication. In his paper Burnet cited Talmage's review, and in a later interview, Talmage said he believed that Burnet \"truthfully had developed the idea before he received my paper\". The theory is now sometimes known as Burnet's clonal selection theory, which overlooks the contributions of Ehrlich, Jerne, Talmage, and the contributions of Lederberg, who conceptualised the genetics of clonal selection.\nBurnet's work on graft-versus-host was in collaboration with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this was known as the Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain  in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune . They looked at the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug  to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human autoimmune disease.\nIn 1960, Burnet scaled back his laboratory work, taking one day off per week to concentrate on writing. In 1963, , which he authored with , was published. He also oversaw an expansion of the Hall Institute and secured funding from the  and the state government to build two further floors in the building and take over some of the space taken up by the pathology department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Despite this, Burnet believed that a world class research body needed to be small enough that one person could effectively run it, and maintained tight control over its activities throughout his leadership. He determined the policies himself, and personally selected all of the research staff and students, relying on a small staff to enforce his plans.\nHe continued to be active in the laboratory until his retirement in 1965, although his experimental time began to decrease as the operations became increasingly focused on immunology; Burnet's work in this area had been mostly theoretical. Gustav Nossal became the next director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. Under Burnet's leadership the Institute had become \"probably the world's best known research centre devoted to the study of immunology.\" However, with the increasing sophistication in medical science and its reliance on more complicated technology, Burnet's lone-wolf approach became less compatible with the research environment, which required more collaboration. In his final years at the helm, Burnet allowed more technical modernisation during the transition period to Nossal's leadership.\nFrom 1937 Burnet was involved in a variety of scientific and public policy bodies, starting with a position on a government advisory council on polio. After he became the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1944, he was considered a public figure and overcame shyness to become a good public speaker. He recognised the importance of co-operation with the media if the general public was to understand science and scientists, and his writings and lectures played an important part in the formulation of public attitudes and policy in Australia on a variety of biological topics. However, despite making many appearances on radio and television, he never became at ease with interviews and had to be selective with outreach engagements due to the many invitations he received, and tended to accept those that had the potential to promote the Institute. Over time, he began to increase his activism, as he felt more confident that he would be able to make an impact as his reputation grew, especially after winning the Nobel Prize, and even more so after his retirement from the directorship of the Institute. Although Burnet was not naturally outgoing, he saw it as the social responsibility of a scientific leader and scholar to publicly speak out and impart wisdom and foresight to the wider community.\nBurnet served as a member or chairman of scientific committees, both in Australia and overseas. Between 1947 and 1953, he was a member of the 's Medical Research Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for medical research in Australia. During this same period (1947\u201352), he was also a member of the  Defence Research and Development Policy Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that Burnet made the recommendation that Australia pursue development of  and  to target neighbouring countries' food stocks and spread infectious diseases. His report was titled . Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; he was concerned that Australians were being exposed to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.\nInternationally, Burnet was a chairman of the Papua New Guinea Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1962 and 1969. At the time, Papua New Guinea was an Australian territory, and Burnet had first travelled there as his son was posted there. His role on the committee allowed him to explore his interest in . He was particularly interested in  (laughing sickness), and lobbied the Australian government to establish the Papua New Guinea Institute of Human Biology. Burnet later helped oversee the institute's contribution to the Anglo-Australian participation in the International Biological Programme in the Field of Human Adaptability.\nBurnet served as first chair for the  (1966\u201369), a Commonwealth initiative to foster interaction between the member countries' elite, and he was also active in the , serving on the Expert Advisory Panels on Virus Diseases and on Immunology between 1952 and 1969 and the World Health Organization Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1969 and 1973.\nIn 1964, he was appointed to sit on the University Council of Victoria's third university  on an interim basis until the institution was formed in 1966. He served until 1970. He advocated a less hierarchical relationship between a professor and student, something seen as a move away from the English tradition prevalent in Australia towards an American model. He also called for the downgrading of the importance placed on the liberal arts. His ideas were too radical for his peers and he stepped down from the role in 1970 after none of his suggestions had made an impact.\nBurnet was opposed to the use of nuclear power in Australia owing to the issues of . He later retracted his objections to , feeling that nuclear power was necessary while other renewable energy sources were being developed. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he was also vocal in the anti-smoking movement; he was one of the first high-profile figures in Australia to educate the public on the dangers of tobacco, and he appeared in a television advertisement criticising the ethics of , and broadcasters for displaying such material. He and fellow activists were surprised that the commercial was allowed to run briefly, before being taken off air by the station, which only further generated attention for the anti-smoking campaign. A former smoker, he had rejected the habit in the 1950s after several friends died. Burnet was also a critic of the  and called for the creation of an international police force.\nFollowing his resignation from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an office at the  in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books on a variety of topics including immunology, ageing and cancer, and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled , which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He was known for his ability to write quickly, often without a final draft, and his ability to convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had much influence. In 1969 he published , considered his magnum opus on immunity, which attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the clonal selection theory. The following year, he wrote , which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused work schedule, often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.\nHe became president of the  in 1965, having been a foundational fellow when the Academy was formed in 1954. He had been offered the presidency in 1958 to replace the inaugural head Sir , but declined, although he served on the council and as vice president in 1961\u201363. As president he was recognised by both government and the public as the leading scientist in Australia. His stature as a scientist gave him the gravitas to end policy disputes, and gave the Academy and its advocacy more credibility in the eyes of government and industry. As such his term was considered to be highly successful. Oliphant said that Burnet's personal prestige was very important in the increased respect the AAS won and that he \"made the biological sciences far more acceptable in Australia\".\nHe helped establish the Academy's Science and Industry Forum, which was formed in the second year of his leadership in order to improve dialogue between researchers and industrialists. It investigated whether a national science policy should be formulated and led to the eventual creation of the . He also laid the foundations of the . When his presidency ended in 1969, the Academy founded the , which is the Academy's highest award for biological sciences.\nAs in many of his previous pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group of the scientific community and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful due to a lack of concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members\u2014such as Burnet\u2014being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.\nIn 1966, Burnet accepted a nomination from Australia Prime Minister Sir  to become the inaugural chairman of the , a body that aimed to increase the professional interchange between the various nations of the . Burnet served in the role for three years and helped start it on a path of steady growth, although he was unable to use it as a personal platform to  espouse the importance of human biology.\nBurnet's essays and books published in his later life caused contention within the scientific community and to the chagrin of his peers Burnet often made pessimistic proclamations about the future of science. In 1966 Burnet wrote an opinion article for  entitled \"Men or Molecules?\" in which he questioned the usefulness of , arguing that it had not and would not contribute anything of use to medicine and that manipulation of the genome as had been demonstrated in bacteria would do more harm to humans than good. Gustav Nossal subsequently described Burnet as \"a biologist with a love-hate affair with biochemistry, which led to a brief but damaging rejection of the worth of molecular biology.\"\nHe delivered the inaugural Oscar Mendelsohn lecture in 1971 at  and advocated policies for Australia such as population control, prevention of war, long-term plans for the management of the environment and natural resources, Aboriginal land rights, socialism, recycling, advertising bans on socially harmful products, and more regulation of the environment. He angrily denounced French nuclear testing in the Pacific, and after consistently voting for the ruling Liberal Party coalition as it ruled for the past few decades, signed an open letter backing the opposition Labor Party of , which took power in 1972. However, he soon spoke out against Whitlam's lack of action against tobacco advertising and French nuclear tests. Burnet often found himself frustrated with the refusal of politicians to base policy on long-term objectives, such as the sustainability of human life.\nIn 1971\u201372, he wrote four books, most notably, , which caused great controversy due to its strident attacks on molecular biology, cellular biology, and claims that cancer and various other diseases were incurable and that it was pointless to try to do so. He also predicted that scientific progress would end soon.\nBurnet spoke and wrote widely on the topic of human biology after his retirement, aiming to reach all strata of society. He courted the media as well as the scientific community, often leading to sensationalist or scientifically unrigorous report of his outspoken views. This often angered colleagues, who viewed him as abusing his stature to deliberately cause a stir.  In 1966 Burnet presented the , focusing on human biology. He provided a conceptual framework for sustainable development; 21 years later the definition provided by the  was almost identical. In 1970 he revised an earlier book which was published as ; it was followed by , which was published in 1978. The books discuss aspects of human biology, a topic which Burnet wrote on extensively in his later years. In  he argued that the roots of all human behaviour can be found in the behaviour of animals; in  he addressed issues of ageing, life, death and the future of mankind. The books strongly polarised the scientific community, and one reviewer described his ideas of sociobiology as \"extreme\" and giving \"a dismal, unappealing view of humanity\". In , he also called for society to accept euthanasia of ill older people, repeat violent criminals, and most controversially, abortion of pregnancies likely to result in disabled children, and infanticide of handicapped newborns. Knowing that there would be a strong backlash for such policies, he departed overseas for a two-month lecture series at the time of the book launch. In his absence, he was strongly assailed in newspaper letters and some correspondents compared his stance on infanticide to that of . At the same time, he also changed his stance on nuclear power and advocated its use, and the reinvestment of revenue for research into solar power. This about face angered the environmental movement.\nHis first wife, Edith Linda Druce, died from lymphoid leukaemia in 1973, after a four-year struggle. During her final years, Burnet refused all offers of lectures overseas to spend more time nursing his ailing wife. For a period after this he became very lethargic and reclusive, numbed by his wife's death. He then moved into Ormond College for company, and resumed beetle collecting, but for a year after her death, Burnet tried to alleviate his grief by writing mock letters to her once a week. Gradually he regained his enthusiasm and began writing again. In 1975, he travelled to California to deliver a series of lectures. In 1976 he married Hazel G. Jenkins, a widowed former singer from a business family in her 70s who was working in the microbiology department as a librarian, and moved out of Ormond College.\nIn 1978 Burnet decided to officially retire; in retirement he wrote two books. During this time, he missed his laboratory work, and he was constrained to social events and theorising. In 1982, Burnet was one of three contributors to , writing about genetic issues and their impact on the nation's impact. As a result of the success of the book, in early 1983, Burnet was appointed to the 70-person Australian Advisory Council of Elders to offer counsel to policymakers, but the group folded after several members became too frail or died.\nBurnet continued to travel and speak, but in the early 1980s, he and his wife became increasingly hampered by illness. Having surmised his illness two years earlier, in November 1984 he underwent surgery for . He made plans to resume scientific meetings, but was then taken ill again, with significant pain in his thorax and legs. Secondary lesions were found in June 1985 and declared to be inoperable and terminal. A supporter of euthanasia, Burnet was unfazed by his imminent death, and he died on 31 August at his son's home at  after two months' of illness. He was given a state funeral by the government of Australia; many of his distinguished colleagues from the Hall Institute such as Nossal and Fenner were pall-bearers, and he was buried near his paternal grandparents after a private family service at  in Koroit, near Port Fairy. Following his death he was honoured by the ; Prime Minister  took the highly unusual step of moving a condolence motion, an honour typically reserved for parliamentarians. Lady Hazel Burnet died in 1990.\nBurnet received extensive honours for his contributions to science and public life during his lifetime. He was  in the , received the Elizabeth II Coronation Medal in 1953, and was appointed to the  (OM) in the 1958 . In 1960 he was the first recipient of the honorary  award. He received a Gold and Silver Star from the Japanese  in 1961.  He was appointed  (KBE) in the , and received the Elizabeth II Jubilee Medal in 1977. In 1978 he was made a  (AK). He was only the fourth person to receive this honour.\nHe was a fellow or honorary member of 30 international Academies of Sciences. He received 10 honorary  degrees from universities including Cambridge, Harvard and Oxford, an honorary  degree from Hahnemann Medical College (now part of ), an honorary Doctor of Medical Science from the  and a  degree from the University of Melbourne. Including his Nobel, he received 19 medals or awards including the  and the  from the Royal Society and the ; he also received 33 international lectureships and 17 lectureships within Australia.\nAfter his death, Australia's largest communicable diseases research institute\u2014the  was renamed in his honour. The Burnet Clinical Research Unit of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute was also named in his honour in 1986. In 1975 his work on immunology was recognised by a 33-cent stamp released by . Seven Australian medical scientists were commemorated in the issue of a set of four Australian stamps released in 1995; he appears on the 45-cent stamp with fellow University of Melbourne graduate . He also appears on a  stamp that was issued in 1997. The centenary of his birth was celebrated in Australia in 1999; a statue of him was erected in Franklin Street, Traralgon; and several events were held in his honour including the release of a new edition of  by Oxford University Press.\nBurnet biographer Christopher Sexton suggests that Burnet's legacy is fourfold: (1) the scope and quality of his research; (2) his nationalistic attitude which led him to stay in Australia, leading to the development of science in Australia and inspiring future generations of Australian scientists; (3) his success establishing the reputation of Australian medical research worldwide; and (4) his books, essays and other writings. In spite of his sometimes controversial ideas on science and humanity,  has noted that \"Burnet's reputation is secure in his achievements as an experimentalist, a theoretician and a leader of the Australian scientific community.\"\n\n\n", "bio_image": "full/4d0977c82cf45275a9ed3197e6f94a3456e67cff.jpg"},

In 1973 he was awarded the , \"for an epic and psychological narrative art which has introduced a new continent into literature\", as it says in the Swedish Academy's citation, the only Australian to have been awarded the prize. White was also the inaugural recipient of the .\nWhite was born in , London, to Victor Martindale White and Ruth (n\u00e9e Withycombe), both Australians, in their apartment overlooking  on 28 May 1912. His family returned to Sydney, Australia, when he was six months old. As a child he lived in a flat with his sister, a nanny, and a maid while his parents lived in an adjoining flat.  In 1916 they moved to a house in  that many years later became a nursing home, Lulworth House, the residents of which included , , and White's partner .\nAt the age of four, White developed asthma, a condition that had taken the life of his maternal grandfather. White's health was fragile throughout his childhood, which precluded his participation in many childhood activities.\nHe loved the theatre, which he first visited at an early age (his mother took him to see  at the age of six). This love was expressed at home when he performed private rites in the garden and danced for his mother's friends.\nAt the age of five, he attended kindergarten at Sandtoft in , in Sydney's .\nAt the age of ten, White was sent to , a boarding school in  in the  of New South Wales, in an attempt to abate his asthma. It took him some time to adjust to the presence of other children. At boarding school, he started to write plays. Even at this early age, White wrote about palpably adult themes. In 1924, the boarding school ran into financial trouble, and the headmaster suggested for White to be sent to a  in England, a suggestion that his parents accepted.\nWhite struggled to adjust to his new surroundings at , England. He later described it as \"a four-year prison sentence\". White withdrew socially and had a limited circle of acquaintances. Occasionally, he would holiday with his parents at European locations, but their relationship remained distant. However he did spend time with his cousin Jack Withycombe during this period, and Jack's daughter  became a mentor to him while he was writing his first book of poems,  between the years 1927\u201329.\nWhile at school in London, White made one close friend, Ronald Waterall, an older boy who shared similar interests. White's biographer, , wrote that \"the two men would walk, arm-in-arm, to London shows; and stand around stage doors crumbing for a glimpse of their favourite stars, giving a practical demonstration of a chorus girl's high kick... with appropriate vocal accompaniment\". When Waterall left school, White withdrew again. He asked his parents if he could leave school to become an actor. The parents compromised and allowed him to finish school early if he came home to Australia to try life on the land. His parents felt that he should work on the land rather than become a writer and hoped that his work as a  would temper his artistic ambitions.\nWhite spent two years working as a  at Bolaro, a 73-square-kilometre (28\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) station near , on the edge of the , in southeastern Australia. Although he grew to respect the land and his health improved, it was clear that he was not cut out for this life.\nFrom 1932 to 1935, White lived in England, studying French and German literature at , . During his time at Cambridge he developed a romantic attraction to a young man who had come to King's College to become an Anglican priest. White dared not speak of his feelings for fear of losing the friendship and, like many other gay men of that period, he feared that his sexuality would doom him to a lonely life. Then, one night, the student priest, after an awkward liaison with two women, admitted to White that women meant nothing to him sexually. That became White's first love affair.\nDuring White's time at Cambridge he published a collection of poetry entitled , and wrote a play named , which was later performed by an amateur group (which included his sister Suzanne) at the tiny  in Sydney. After being admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1935, White briefly settled in London, where he lived in an area that was frequented by artists. There, the young author thrived creatively for a time, writing several unpublished works and reworking , a novel that he had written while jackarooing. In 1937, White's father died, leaving him ten thousand pounds in inheritance. The fortune enabled him to write full-time in relative comfort. Two more plays followed before he succeeded in finding a publisher for . The novel was received well in London but poorly in Australia. He began writing another novel, , but abandoned it before its completion after receiving negative comments, a decision that he later admitted regretting.\nIn 1936, White met the painter , 18 years his senior, who became an important influence in his life and work. The two men never became lovers but remained firm friends. In White's own words, \"He became what I most needed, an intellectual and aesthetic mentor\". They had many similarities: they were both gay and they both felt like outsiders in their own families; as a result they both had ambivalent feelings about their families and backgrounds, yet both maintained close and lifelong links with their families, particularly their mothers. They also both appreciated the benefits of social standing and connections and Christian symbolism and biblical themes are common in both artists' work.\nWhite dedicated his first novel  to De Maistre and acknowledged De Maistre's influence on his writing. In 1947, De Maistre's painting  was used as the cover for the first edition of White's . White bought many of De Maistre's paintings. In 1974 White gave all his paintings by De Maistre to the .\nTowards the end of the 1930s, White spent time in the United States, including , Massachusetts, and , which were artistic hotbeds at the time, where he wrote . By the time World War II broke out, he had returned to London and joined the British . He was accepted as an intelligence officer, and was posted to the Middle East. He served in Egypt, Palestine, and Greece before the war was over. While in the Middle East, he had an affair with a Greek army officer, , who was to become his life partner.\nWhite and Lascaris lived together in Cairo for six years before moving to a small farm purchased by White at , near Sydney, in 1948. After the death of White's mother in 1963, they moved into a large house, , in , where they lived for the rest of their lives.\nAfter the war, White once again returned to Australia, buying an old house in , now a Sydney suburb but then semi-rural. He named the house \"The Dogwoods,\" after trees he planted there. In this house, he settled down with Lascaris, the Greek he had met during the war. They lived there for 18 years, selling flowers, vegetables, milk, and cream as well as pedigreed puppies. During these years he started to make a reputation for himself as a writer, publishing  and  in the United States in 1955 and shortly after in the United Kingdom.  was released to rave reviews in the United States, but in what had become a typical pattern, it was panned in Australia. White had doubts about whether to continue writing after his books were largely dismissed in Australia (three of them having been called 'un-Australian' by critics), but, in the end, he decided to persevere. His first breakthrough in Australia came when his next novel, , won the inaugural .\nIn 1961, White published . It was to become both a bestseller and a prizewinner, gaining him a second Miles Franklin Award. In 1963, White and Lascaris decided to sell the house at Castle Hill. A number of White's works from the 1960s depict the fictional town of Sarsaparilla, including his collection of short stories, , and the play, . By now, he had clearly established his reputation as one of the world's great authors, but remained an essentially private person, resisting opportunities for interviews and public appearances although his circle of friends had widened significantly.\nIn 1968, White wrote , a searing character portrait of an artist. Many people drew links to the Sydney painter  (1904\u201384) and White's friend, the painter , but White denied the connections. Patrick White was an art collector who had, as a young man, been deeply impressed by his friends  and , and later said he wished he had been an artist.  By the mid-1960s, he had also become interested in encouraging dozens of young and less established artists, such as , , and . White was later friends with , the young star of Australian painting, in the 1970s. That friendship ended when White felt that Whiteley, a heroin addict, was deceitful and pushy about selling his paintings. A portrait of White by  won the 1962 .\nWhite decided not to accept any more prizes for his work, and he declined both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by  to work on a screenplay for  but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia's decision to participate in the . His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the , but in 1971, after losing to , he wrote to a friend: .\nNevertheless, in 1973, White did accept the Nobel Prize \"for an epic and psychological narrative art, which has introduced a new continent into literature\". His cause was said to have been championed by a Scandinavian diplomat resident in Australia. White enlisted Nolan to travel to Stockholm to accept the prize on his behalf. The award had an immediate impact on his career, as his publisher doubled the print run for  and gave him a larger advance for his next novel. White used the money from the prize to establish a trust to fund the , given annually to established creative writers who have received little public recognition. He was invited by the  to be seated on the floor of the House in recognition of his achievement. White declined, explaining that his nature could not easily adapt itself to such a situation. The last time such an invitation had been extended was in 1928, to .\nWhite was made  for 1974, but in a typically rebellious fashion, his acceptance speech encouraged Australians to spend the day reflecting on the state of the country. Privately, he was less than enthusiastic about it. In a letter to Marshall Best on 27 January 1974, he wrote: \"Something terrible happened to me last week. There is an organisation which chooses an Australian of the Year, who has to appear at an official lunch in  on . This year I was picked on as they had run through all the swimmers, tennis players, yachtsmen\".\nWhite and Lascaris hosted many dinner parties at Highbury, their Centennial Park home, in a leafy part of the affluent Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. In , his biographer  portrays White as a genial host but one who easily fell out with friends.\nWhite supported the conservative, business oriented  until the election of 's  government and, following the , he became particularly , making a rare appearance on national television to broadcast his views on the matter. White also publicly expressed his admiration for the historian , satirist , and unionist .\nDuring the 1970s, White's health began to deteriorate: his teeth were crumbling, his eyesight was failing, and he had chronic lung problems - however, he also became a more openly political person, and began sometimes commenting on current issues. He was among the first group of Companions of the  in 1975 but resigned in June 1976 in protest at the dismissal of the Whitlam government in November 1975 by the Governor-General Sir . In 1979, his novel  was shortlisted for the , but White requested that it to be removed to give younger writers a chance to win. (The prize was won by , who ironically was just four years younger than White.) Soon after, White announced that he had written his last novel, and from then on, he would write only for radio or the stage.\nDirector  introduced himself to White while walking down a Sydney street, some time after White had seen a politically loaded stage revue by Sharman, , which had been panned by Sydney newspaper critics, and had written a letter to the editor of a newspaper defending the show. White felt somewhat cautious at first, not least due to the gulf in age between them, but after a while the two men became friends and Sharman and his theatrical circle, as well as his visual style as a director, would inspire White to a couple of new plays, notably  with its satirical portrayal of a posh and vulgar upper-class Sydney society. A few years later, Sharman asked White if he could make a film of . White agreed and wrote the screenplay for the film.\nIn 1981, White published his autobiography, , which explored issues about which he had publicly said little such as his homosexuality, his dislike of the \"subservient\" attitude of Australian society towards Britain and the Royal family, and also the distance he had felt towards his mother. On , 1982, White addressed a crowd of 30,000 people, calling for a ban on  and for the destruction of .\nIn 1986 White released one last novel, , but it was published under the pen name \"Alex Xenophon Demirjian Gray\" with White named as editor. In the same year,  was turned into , with music by  and the libretto adapted by . White refused to see it when it was first performed at the , because  had been invited, and chose instead to see it later in Sydney. In 1987, White wrote , with his musings on ageing and society's efforts to achieve aesthetic perfection. When David Marr finished his biography of White in July 1990, his subject spent nine days going over the details with him.\nWhite died in Sydney on 30 September 1990.\nIn 2009, The Sydney Theatre Company staged White's play . In 2010 White received posthumous recognition for his novel , which was shortlisted for the  for 1970.\nIn 2011 Fred Schepisi's  of  was released with screenplay adaptation by ,  playing the son Basil,  as the daughter Dorothy, and  as the dying matriarch Elizabeth Hunter. This is the first screen realisation of a White novel, fittingly the one that played a key role in the Swedish panel's choice of White as Nobel prize winner.\nIn 1970, White was offered a knighthood but declined it.\nBoth White and  were members of the first group of six people appointed  (AC) in the civil division, (now called the general division). The awards were announced in the 1975 Queen's Birthday Honours List.

As of 2020, he is the youngest ever  in physics, having received the award at the age of 25 years (youngest ever Nobel winner in any field is , who received Nobel Peace prize in 2014 at the age of 17). Bragg was the director of the , Cambridge, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was reported by  and  in February 1953.\nBragg was born in , South Australia to  (1862\u20131942),  Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the , and Gwendoline (1869\u20131929), daughter of , government astronomer of South Australia.\nHe showed an early interest in science and mathematics. Shortly after starting school he fell from his tricycle and broke his arm. His father, who had read about 's experiments in Europe and was performing his own experiments, used the newly discovered X-rays and his experimental equipment to examine the broken arm. This is the first recorded surgical use of X-rays in Australia.\nIn 1900, Bragg was a student at , followed by five years at . He went to the University of Adelaide at the age of 16 to study mathematics, chemistry and physics, graduating in 1908. In the same year his father accepted the Cavendish chair of physics at the , and brought the family to England. Bragg entered  in the autumn of 1909 and received a major scholarship in mathematics, despite taking the exam while in bed with . After initially excelling in mathematics, he transferred to the physics course in the later years of his studies, and graduated with first class honours in 1911. In 1914 Bragg was elected to a Fellowship at Trinity College \u2013 a Fellowship at a Cambridge college involves the submission and defence of a thesis.\nAmong Bragg's other interests was ; his personal collection amounted to specimens from some 500 species; all personally collected from South Australia. He discovered a new species of  \u2013 , named for him by .\nThe composition of X-rays was unknown, his father argued that X-rays are streams of particles, others argued that they are waves.  directed an X-ray beam at a crystal in front of a photographic plate; alongside of the spot where the beam struck there were additional spots from deflected rays \u2013 hence X-rays are waves. In 1912, as a first-year research student at Cambridge, W. L. Bragg, while strolling by the river, had the insight that crystals made from parallel sheets of atoms would not diffract X-ray beams that struck their surface at most angles because X-rays deflected by collisions with atoms would be out of phase, cancelling one another out. However, when the X-ray beam stuck at an angle at which the distances it passed between atomic sheets in the crystal equalled the X-ray's wavelength then those deflected would be in phase and produce a spot on a nearby film. From this insight he wrote the simple  that relates the wavelength of the X-ray and the distance between atomic sheets in a simple crystal to the angles at which an impinging X-ray beam would be reflected.\nHis father built an  in which a crystal could be rotated to precise angles while measuring the energy of reflections. This enabled father and son to measure the distances between the atomic sheets in a number of simple crystals. They calculated the spacing of the atoms from the weight of the crystal and the , which enabled them to measure the wavelengths of the X-rays produced by different metallic targets in the X-ray tubes. W. H. Bragg reported their results at meetings and in a paper, giving credit to \"his son\" (unnamed) for the equation, but not as a co-author, which gave his son \"some heartaches\", .\nBragg was commissioned early in  in the  as a  of the . In 1915 he was seconded to the  to develop a method to localise enemy artillery from the boom of their firing. On 2 September 1915 his brother was killed during the . Shortly afterwards, he and his father were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. He was 25 years old and remains the youngest science laureate. The problem with  was that the heavy guns boomed at too low a frequency to be detected by a microphone. After months of frustrating failure he and his group devised a hot wire air wave detector that solved the problem. In this work he was aided by , ,  and Henry Harold Hemming. British sound ranging was very effective; there was a unit in every British Army and their system was adopted by the Americans when they entered the war. For his work during the war he was awarded the  and appointed . He was also  on 16 June 1916, 4 January 1917 and 7 July 1919.\nHot wire sound ranging was used in  during which he served as a civilian adviser.\nBetween the wars, from 1919 to 1937, he worked at the  as  of Physics. He became the director of the  in Teddington in 1937.\nAfter World War II, Bragg returned to Cambridge, splitting the  into research groups. He believed that \"the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants\".\nWhen demobilised he returned to crystallography at Cambridge. They had agreed that father would study organic crystals, son would investigate inorganic compounds. In 1919 when , a long-time family friend, moved to Cambridge, Lawrence Bragg replaced him as Langworthy Professor of Physics at the . He recruited an excellent faculty, including former sound rangers, but he believed that his knowledge of physics was weak and he had no classroom experience. The students, many veterans, were critical and rowdy. He was deeply shaken but with family support he pulled himself together and prevailed. He and R. W. James measured the absolute energy of reflected X-rays, which validated a formula derived by C. G. Darwin before the war. Now they could determine the number of electrons in the reflecting targets, and they were able to decipher the structures of more complicated crystals like silicates. It was still difficult: requiring repeated guessing and retrying. In the late 1920s they eased the analysis by using  on the data.\nIn 1930 he became deeply disturbed while weighing a job offer from Imperial College, London. His family rallied around and he recovered his balance while they spent 1931 in Munich, where he did research.\nHe became director of the  in Teddington in 1937, bringing some co-workers along. However, administration and committees took much of his time away from the workbench.\nRutherford died and the search committee named Lawrence Bragg as next in the line of the  who direct the . The Laboratory had an eminent history in atomic physics and some members were wary of a crystallographer, which Bragg surmounted by even-handed administration. He worked on improving the interpretation of diffraction patterns. In the small crystallography group was a refugee research student without a mentor: . He showed Bragg X-ray diffraction data from , which suggested that the structure of giant biological molecules might be deciphered. Bragg appointed Perutz as his research assistant and within a few months obtained additional support with a grant from the . The work was suspended during the Second World War when Perutz was interned as an enemy alien and then worked in military research.\nDuring the war the Cavendish offered a shortened graduate course which emphasised the electronics needed for . Bragg worked on the structure of metals and consulted on sonar and sound ranging, they still used the Tucker microphone. He became Sir Lawrence in 1941. His father died in 1942, during which Bragg served for six months as Scientific Liaison Officer to Canada. He organised periodic conferences on X-ray analysis, which was widely used in military research.\nAfter the war he led in the formation of the  and was elected its first president. He reorganised the Cavendish into units to reflect his conviction that \"the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants, helped by one or more first-class instrument mechanics and a workshop in which the general run of apparatus can be constructed.\" Senior members of staff now had offices, telephones and secretarial support. The scope of the department was enlarged with a new unit on radio astronomy. His own work focused on the structure of metals, using both X-rays and the . In 1947 he persuaded the  (MRC) to support what he described as the \"gallant attempt\" to determine protein structure as the , initially consisting of Perutz,  and two assistants. Bragg worked with them, by 1960 they had resolved the structure of  to the atomic level. After this he was less involved; their analysis of  was easier after they incorporated two mercury atoms as markers in each molecule. The first monumental triumph of the MRC was decoding the structure of DNA by  and . Bragg announced the discovery at a  on proteins in Belgium on 8 April 1953, it went unreported by the press. He then gave a talk at  in London on Thursday 14 May 1953, which resulted in an article by  in the  of London on Friday 15 May 1953, entitled \"Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life\". Bragg nominated Crick, Watson and  for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; Wilkins' share recognised the contribution of X-ray crystallographers at . Among them was , whose \"\" showed that DNA was a double , not the triple helix that  had proposed. Franklin died before the prize (which only goes to living people) was awarded.\nIn 1953 the Braggs moved into the elegant flat for the Resident Professor in the  in London, the position his father had occupied when he died. In 1934 and 1961 Lawrence had delivered the  and since 1938 he had been Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Institution, delivering an annual lecture. His father's successors had weakened the Institution, so Bragg had to rebuild it. He bolstered finances by enlisting corporate sponsors, the traditional Friday Evening Discourses were followed by a dinner party for the speaker and carefully selected possible patrons, more than 120 of them each year. \"Two of these Discourses in 1965 gave him particular pleasure. On 7 May, Lady Bragg, who had been a member of the Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce (1951\u201355) and was Chairman of the , lectured on 'Changing patterns in marriage and divorce'; and on 15 November, Bragg listened with evident pride to the Discourse on 'Oscillations and noise in jet engines' given by his engineer-son , who was then Chief Scientist at Rolls Royce Ltd and later became Vice-Chancellor of .\" He also introduced a programme of highly regarded Schools' Lectures, enlivened by the elaborate demonstrations that were a hallmark of the Institution. He gave three of these lectures on \"electricity\".\nHe continued research in the Institution by recruiting a small group to work the Davy-Faraday Laboratory in the basement and in the adjoining house, supported by grants he obtained. A visitor to the laboratory succeeded in inserting heavy metals into the enzyme ; the structure of its crystal was solved in 1965 at the Royal Institution by  and his coworkers, with the computations on the 9,040 reflections performed on the digital computer at the University of London, which greatly facilitated the work. Two of the illustrations of the positioning of amino acids in the chain were drawn by Bragg. Unlike myoglobin, in which nearly 80 per cent of the amino-acid residues are in the  conformation, in lysozyme the alpha-helix content is only about 40 per cent of the amino-acid residues found in four main stretches. Other stretches are of the , a conformation that they had proposed earlier. In this conformation, every third peptide is hydrogen-bonded back to the first peptide, thus forming a ring containing ten atoms. They had the complete structure of an enzyme in time for Bragg's 75th birthday. He became Professor Emeritus in 1966.\nX-ray analysis of protein structure flourished in subsequent years, determining the structures of scores of proteins in laboratories around the world. Twenty eight Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work using X-ray analysis. The disadvantage of the method is that it must be done on crystals, which precludes seeing changes in shape when enzymes bind substrates and the like. This problem was solved by the development of another line Bragg had initiated, using modified electron microscopes to image single frozen molecules: .\nIn his long association with the  he was:\nIn 1921 he married Alice Hopkinson (1899\u20131989), a cousin of a friend who had been killed in the war. They had four children, the engineer  (1923\u20132014), David William (1926\u20132005), Margaret Alice, born 1931, (who married the diplomat ) and Patience Mary, born 1935. Alice was on the staff at  until Bragg was appointed director of the National Physical Laboratory in 1937. She was active in a number of public bodies and served as  from 1945-46.\nBragg's hobbies included drawing \u2013 family letters were illustrated with lively sketches \u2013 painting, literature and a lifelong interest in gardening. When he moved to London, he missed having a garden and so worked as a part-time gardener, unrecognised by his employer, until a guest at the house expressed surprise at seeing him there. He died at a hospital near his home at , , Suffolk. He was buried in ; his son David is buried in the  in Cambridge, where Bragg's friend, who had he survived would have been his brother-in-law, Rudolph Cecil Hopkinson is also buried.\nIn August 2013, Bragg's relative, the broadcaster , presented a BBC Radio 4 programme (\"Bragg on the Braggs\") on the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics winners.\nBragg was elected a  \u2013 \"a qualification that makes other ones irrelevant\".

Although Graeme Hunter, in his book on Bragg , argued that he was more a crystallographer than a physicist, Bragg's lifelong activity showed otherwise\u2014he was more of a physicist than anything else.

For this work, she was awarded the 2009 , sharing it with Greider and , becoming the first Australian woman Nobel laureate. She also worked in , and was controversially dismissed from the  Administration's .\n\nElizabeth Helen Blackburn, one of seven children, was born in , , on 26 November 1948 to parents who were both family physicians. Her family moved to the city of  when she was four, where she attended the Broadland House Church of England Girls' Grammar School (later amalgamated with ) until the age of sixteen. Upon her family's relocation to , she attended , and ultimately gained very high marks in the end-of-year final statewide matriculation exams. She went on to earn a  in 1970 and  in 1972, both from the  in the field of biochemistry. Blackburn then went to receive her  in 1975 from the , where she worked with Frederick Sanger developing methods to sequence DNA using RNA, as well as studying the bacteriophage . It was also here, the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge University, where Blackburn met her husband John Sedat. Blackburn's soon to be husband had taken a position at Yale, where she then decided to finish her postdoctoral. \u201cThus it was that love brought me to a most fortunate and influential choice: Joe Gall\u2019s lab at Yale.\u201d\nDuring her postdoctoral work at Yale, Blackburn was doing research on the protozoan  and noticed a repeating  at the end of the linear rDNA which varied in size Blackburn then noticed that this hexanucleotide at the end of the chromosome contained a TTAGGG sequence that was , and the terminal end of the chromosomes were palindromic. These characteristics allowed Blackburn and colleagues to conduct further research on the protozoan. Using the telomeric repeated end of , Blackburn and colleague Jack Szostak showed the unstable replicating plasmids of yeast were protected from degradation, proving that these sequences contained characteristics of telomeres. This research also proved the telomeric repeats of  were conserved evolutionarily between the species. Through this research, Blackburn and collaborators noticed the replication system for chromosomes was not likely to add to the lengthening of the telomere, and that the addition of these hexanucleotides to the chromosomes was likely due to the activity of an enzyme that is able to transfer specific functional groups. The proposition of a possible transferase-like enzyme led Blackburn and PhD student Carol W. Greider to the discovery of an enzyme with reverse transcriptase activity that was able to fill in the terminal ends of telomeres without leaving the chromosome incomplete and unable to divide without loss of the end of the chromosome. This 1985 discovery led to the purification of this enzyme in lab, showing the transferase-like enzyme contained both RNA and protein components. The RNA portion of the enzyme served as a template for adding the telomeric repeats to the incomplete telomere, and the protein added enzymatic function for the addition of these repeats.Through this breakthrough, the term \u201ctelomerase\u201d was given to the enzyme, solving the end-replication process that had troubled scientists at the time.\n works by adding base pairs to the overhang of DNA on the 3\u2019 end, extending the strand until DNA polymerase and an RNA primer can complete the complementary strand and successfully synthesize the double stranded DNA. Since DNA polymerase only synthesizes DNA in the leading strand direction, the shortening of the telomere results. Through their research, Blackburn and collaborators were able to show that the telomere is effectively replenished by the enzyme telomerase, which conserves cellular division by preventing the rapid loss of genetic information internal to the telomere, leading to cellular aging.\n\n\nOn January 1, 2016, Blackburn was interviewed about her studies, discovering telomerase, and her current research. When she was asked to recall the moment of telomerase discovery she stated:In 1978, Blackburn joined the faculty of the , in the Department of Molecular Biology. In 1990, she moved across the San Francisco Bay to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the  (UCSF), where she served as the Department Chair from 1993 to 1999 and was the Morris Herzstein Professor of Biology and Physiology at UCSF. Blackburn became a Professor Emeritus at UCSF at the end of 2015.\nBlackburn, co-founded the company Telomere Health which offers telomere length testing to the public, but later severed ties with the company.\nIn 2015, Elizabeth Blackburn was announced as the new President of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. \u201cFew scientists garner the kind of admiration and respect that Dr. Blackburn receives from her peers for her scientific accomplishments and her leadership, service and integrity,\u201d says Irwin M. Jacobs, chairman of Salk's Board of Trustees, on Blackburn's appointment as President of the Institute. \u201cHer deep insight as a scientist, her vision as a leader, and her warm personality will prove invaluable as she guides the Salk Institute on its continuing journey of discovery.\u201d \u00a0In 2017, she announced her plans to retire from the Salk Institute the following year.\nFor their research and contributions to the understanding of telomeres and the enzyme telomerase, Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider, and Jack Szostaks were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The substantial research on the effects of chromosomal protection from telomerase, and the impact this has on cellular division has been a revolutionary catalyst in the field of molecular biology. For example, the addition of telomerase to cells that do not possess this enzyme has shown to bypass the limit of cellular aging in those cells, thereby linking this enzyme to reduced cellular aging. The addition of telomerase, and the presence of the enzyme in cancer cells has been shown to provide an immunity mechanism for the cell in proliferating, linking the transferase activity to increased cellular growth and reduced sensitivity for cellular signalling. The importance of discovering this enzyme has since sent led her continued research at the University of California San Francisco, where she studies the effect of telomeres and telomerase activity on cellular aging.\nBlackburn was appointed a member of the  in 2002. She supported human embryonic cell research, in opposition to the Bush Administration. Her Council terms were terminated by  directive on 27 February 2004. Dr. Blackburn believes that she was dismissed from the Council due to her disapproval of the Bush administration's position against stem cell research. This was followed by expressions of outrage over her removal by many scientists, 170 of whom signed an open letter to the president maintaining that she was fired because of political opposition to her advice.\nScientists and ethicists at the time even went as far to say that Blackburn's removal was in violation of Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which \u201crequires balance on such advisory bodies\u201d\n\"There is a growing sense that scientific research\u2014which, after all, is defined by the quest for truth\u2014is being manipulated for political ends,\" wrote Blackburn. \"There is evidence that such manipulation is being achieved through the stacking of the membership of advisory bodies and through the delay and misrepresentation of their reports.\"\nBlackburn serves on the Science Advisory Board of the Regenerative Medicine Foundation formerly known as the Genetics Policy Institute.\nBlackburn's first book  (2017) was co-authored with  Dr. Elissa Epel of Aging, Metabolism, and Emotions (AME) Center at the UCSF Center for Health and Community. Blackburn comments on aging reversal and care for one's telomeres through lifestyle: managing chronic stress, exercising, eating better and getting enough sleep; telomere testing, plus cautions and advice. While studying telomeres and the replenishing enzyme, telomerase, Blackburn discovered a vital role played by these protective caps that revolved around one central idea: aging of cells. The book hones in on many of the effects that poor health can have on telomeres and telomerase activity. Since telomeres shorten with every division of a cell, replenishing these caps is essential to long term cell growth. Through research and data, Blackburn explained that people that lead stressful lives exhibit less telomerase functioning in the body, which leads to a decrease in the dividing capabilities of the cell. Once telomeres shorten drastically, the cells can no longer divide, meaning the tissues they replenish with every division would therefore die out, highlighting the aging mechanism in humans. To increase telomerase activity in people with stress-filled lives, Blackburn suggests moderate exercise, even 15 minutes a day, which has been proven to stimulate telomerase activity and replenish the telomere.\nBlackburn also states that unhappiness in lives also has an effect on the shortening of telomeres. In a study done on divorced couples, their telomere length was \"significantly shorter\" compared to couples in healthy relationships, and Blackburn states, \"There's an obvious stressor... we are intensely social beings.\" She suggests to include positivity into our daily lives to increase health as well. While increasing the amount of exercise, decreasing stress, tobacco use, and maintaining a balanced sleep schedule, Blackburn explains that our telomeres can be drastically maintained and prevented from rapid shortening, leading to a decrease in the aging process of our cells. Blackburn also tells the readers to be wary of clinical pills who proclaim to lengthen or telomeres and protect the body from aging. She says that these pills and creams have no scientific proof of being anti-aging supplements, and that the key to preserving our telomeres and stimulating telomerase activity comes from leading a healthy life.\nIn recent years Blackburn and her colleagues have been investigating the effect of stress on telomerase and telomeres with particular emphasis on  meditation. She is also one of several biologists (and one of two Nobel Prize laureates) in the 1995 science documentary . Studies suggest that chronic psychological stress may accelerate ageing at the cellular level. Intimate partner violence was found to shorten telomere length in formerly abused women versus never abused women, possibly causing poorer overall health and greater morbidity in abused women.\nAt the University of California San Francisco, Blackburn currently researches telomeres and telomerase in many organisms, from yeast to human cells. The lab is focused on telomere maintenance, and how this has an impact on cellular aging. Many chronic diseases have been associated with the improper maintenance of these telomeres, thereby effecting cellular division, cycling, and impaired growth. At the cutting edge of telomere research, the Blackburn lab currently investigates the impact of limited maintenance of telomeres in cells through altering the enzyme telomerase.\nBlackburns awards and honors include:\nBlackburn was elected:\nIn 2007, Blackburn was listed among 's \nBlackburn splits her time living between La Jolla and  with her husband, scientist John W. Sedat, whom she met while at Cambridge, and has a son, Benjamin.

He married the daughter of president . Saavedra Lamas achieved renown not only as foreign minister of Argentina for his practical work in drafting international agreements and in conducting international mediation, but also as a professor for his scholarship in the fields of labor legislation and international law.\nSaavedra Lamas was a distinguished student at Lacordaire College and at the  where he received the Doctor of Laws degree in 1903, . After study in Paris and travel abroad, he accepted a professorship in law and constitutional history at the , where he began the teaching career that was to span more than forty years. Later, he inaugurated a course in sociology at the University of Buenos Aires, taught political economy and constitutional law in the Law School of the university, and eventually served as the president of the university.\nSaavedra Lamas was a leading Argentine academician in two areas. A pioneer in the field of labor legislation, he edited several treatises on labor legislation in Argentina and on the need for a universally recognized doctrine on the treatment of labor - among them, Centro de legislac\u00edon social y del trabajo (1927) [Center of Social and Labor Legislation], Trait\u00e9s internationaux de type social (1924), C\u00f3digo nacional del trabajo (three volumes, 1933) [National Code of Labor Law]. In the arena of practical affairs, Saavedra Lamas drafted legislation affecting labor in Argentina, supported the founding of the International Labor Organization in 1919, and presided over the ILO Conference of 1928 in Geneva while serving simultaneously as leader of the Argentine delegation.\nIn international law, his other field of major scholarly interest, he published \"La Crise de la codification et de la doctrine Argentine de droit international\" (1931); and he spoke, wrote, or drafted legislation on many subjects with international ramifications - among them, asylum, colonization, immigration, arbitration, and international peace. His brief Vida internacional, which he wrote at the age of seventy, is an urbane by-product of all this study and experience.\nSaavedra Lamas began his political career in 1906 as director of Public Credit and then became the secretary-general for the municipality of Buenos Aires in 1907. In 1908 he was elected to the first of two successive terms in Parliament. There he initiated legislation regarding coastal water rights, irrigation, sugar production, government finances, colonization, and immigration. His main interest, however, lay in foreign affairs. He provided leadership in saving Argentina's arbitration treaty with Italy, which almost foundered in 1907-1908, and eventually became the unofficial adviser to both the legislature and the foreign office on the analysis and implications of proposed foreign treaties. Saavedra Lamas though was also a controversial public figure as he was seen by the masses as an elitist patrician who was too conservative and favored British intervention, especially in railroad construction.\nAppointed minister of Justice and Education in 1915, he instituted educational reforms by integrating the different divisions of public education and by developing a curriculum at the intermediate level for the vocational and technical training of manpower needed in a developing industrial country.\nWhen General  became president of Argentina in 1932, he appointed Saavedra Lamas as foreign minister. In this post for six years, Saavedra Lamas brought international prestige to Argentina. He played an important role in every South American diplomatic issue of the middle thirties, induced Argentina to rejoin the League of Nations after an absence of thirteen years, and represented Argentina at virtually every international meeting of consequence during this period.\nHis work in ending the  between Paraguay and Bolivia (1932\u20131935) had not only local significance but generalized international importance as well. When he took over the foreign office, he immediately engaged in a series of moves to lay the diplomatic groundwork for a negotiated settlement of this dispute. In 1932 he initiated at Washington the Declaration of August 3 which put the American states on record as refusing to recognize any territorial change in the hemisphere brought about by force. Next, he drew up a Treaty of Nonaggression and Conciliation which was signed by six South American countries in October, 1933, and by all of the American countries at the Seventh Pan-American Conference at Montevideo two months later. In 1935 he organized mediation by six neutral American nations which resulted in the cessation of hostilities between Paraguay and Bolivia. Meanwhile, in 1934, Saavedra Lamas presented the South American Antiwar Pact to the League of Nations where it was well received and signed by eleven countries. Acclaimed for all of these efforts, he was elected president of the Assembly of the League of Nations in 1936.\nAfter his retirement from the foreign ministry in 1938, Saavedra Lamas returned to academic life, became president of the University of Buenos Aires for two years (1941\u20131943), and rounded out his career as a professor for an additional three years (1943\u20131946).\nSaavedra Lamas was known as a strict disciplinarian in his office, a logician at the conference table, a charming host in his home or his art gallery, and a man of sartorial elegance who wore, it is said, the highest collars in Buenos Aires. In addition to the , he was awarded the  and analogous honors from ten other countries.\nHe died in 1959 at the age of eighty from the effects of a brain hemorrhage.\nIn March 2014 his solid gold Nobel medal was put up for auction after being found in a South American pawn shop.\nIn August 2014 a project for rebuying his Nobel medal by the Argentine Nation was presented at the Argentine congress.

The first 30 out of 100 samples showed no support for their hypothesis. However, it was discovered that the lab technicians had been throwing out the cultures after 2 days. This was standard practice for throat swabs where other organisms in the mouth rendered cultures as not useful after 2 days. Due to other hospital work, the lab technicians did not have time to immediately throw out the 31st test on the second day, and so it stayed from Thursday through to the Monday. In this sample, they discovered the presence of H. pylori.

In 1936 he traveled to England to begin advanced studies at the , under the supervision of another Nobel Prize winner, Sir , who had obtained that distinction in 1929 for his work in  and in revealing the critical role of  in maintaining good health. Leloir's research in the Biochemical Laboratory of Cambridge centered around , more specifically the effects of  and  on succinic dehydrogenase; from this moment Leloir began to specialize in researching carbohydrate metabolism.\nLeloir returned to Buenos Aires in 1937 after his brief stay at Cambridge. 1943 saw Leloir marry; Luis Leloir and Amelia Zuberbuhler (1920-2013) would later have a daughter also named Amelia. However, his return to Argentina was amidst conflict and strife;  Houssay had been expelled from the University of Buenos Aires for signing a public petition opposing the  regime in  and the military government led  by . Leloir fled to the , where he assumed the position of associate professor in the Department of  at , collaborating with  and  and thereafter worked with  at the College of Physicians and Surgeons,  as a research assistant. Leloir would later credit Green with instilling within him the initiative to establish his own research in Argentina.\nIn 1945, Leloir ended his exile and returned to Argentina to work under Houssay at the , which Leloir would direct from its creation in 1947 by businessman and patron . Initially, the institute was composed of five rooms, a bathroom, central hall, patio, kitchen, and changing room. During the final years of the 1940s, although lacking financial resources and operating with very low-cost teams, Leloir's successful experiments would reveal the chemical origins of sugar synthesis in  as well as the  of  in the liver; together with J. M. Mu\u00f1oz, he produced an active cell-free system, a first in scientific research. It had initially been assumed that in order to study a cell, scientists could not separate it from its host organism, as oxidation could only occur in intact cells. Along the way, Mu\u00f1oz and Leloir, unable to procure the costly centrifuge needed to separate cell contents, improvised by spinning a tire stuffed with salt and ice.\nBy 1947 he had formed a team that included \nCaputto, Enrico Cabib, Ra\u00fal Trucco, Alejandro Paladini, Carlos Cardini and Jos\u00e9 Luis Reissig, with whom he investigated and discovered why a malfunctioning kidney and  helped cause . That same year,  his colleague , in his investigations of the , made discoveries regarding carbohydrate storage and its subsequent transformation into a reserve energy form in organisms.\nAt the beginning of 1948, Leloir and his team identified the sugar nucleotides that were fundamental to the metabolism of carbohydrates, turning the Instituto Campomar into a biochemistry institution well known throughout the world. Immediately thereafter, Leloir received the Argentine Scientific Society Prize,  one of the many awards he would receive both in Argentina and internationally. During this time, his team dedicated itself to the study of ; Leloir and his colleagues elucidated the primary mechanisms of galactose metabolism (now coined the ) and determined the cause of galactosemia, a serious  that resulted in .\nThe following year, he reached an agreement with Rolando Garc\u00eda, dean of the  at UBA, which named Leloir, Carlos Eugenio Cardini and Enrico Cabib as titular professors in the University's newly founded Biochemical Institute. The Institute would help develop scientific programs in budding Argentine universities as well as attract researchers and scholars from the United States, , England, France, Spain, and other Latin American countries.\nFollowing Campomar's death in 1957, Leloir and his team applied to the  in the United States desperate for funding, and surprisingly was accepted. In 1958, the Institute found a new home in a former all-girls school, a donation from the Argentine government. As Leloir and his research gained greater prominence, further research came from the Argentine Research Council, and the Institute would later become associated with the University of Buenos Aires.\nAs his work in the laboratory was coming to an end, Leloir continued his teaching position in the Department of Natural Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires, taking a hiatus only to complete his studies at Cambridge and at the Enzyme Research Laboratory in the United States.\nIn 1983, Leloir became one of the founding members of the Third World Academy of Sciences, later renamed the .\nOn December 2, 1970, Leloir received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry from the King of  for his discovery of the  in , becoming only the third Argentine to receive the prestigious honor in any field. In his acceptance speech at , he borrowed from 's famous 1940 speech to the  and remarked, \"never have I received so much for so little\". Leloir and his team reportedly celebrated by drinking champagne from test tubes, a rare departure from the humility and frugality that characterized the atmosphere of Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Campomar under Leloir's direction. The $80,000 prize money was spent directly on research, and when asked about the significance of his achievement, Leloir responded:\nLeloir published a short autobiography, entitled \"Long Ago and Far Away\" in the 1983 . The title, Leloir claims, is derived from one of 's novels that depicted the country wildlife and scenery of Leloir's childhood.\nHe died in Buenos Aires December 2, 1987, of a heart attack soon after returning to his home from the laboratory, and is buried in . , a friend and colleague of Leloir, claims that his lasting legacy was proving that \"scientific research on an international level, although precarious, was possible in an underdeveloped country in the middle of political strife\" and credits Leloir's vigilance and will for his ultimate success. With his research in dire financial straits, Leloir often resorted to homemade gadgets and contraptions to continue his work in the laboratory. In one instance, Leloir reportedly used waterproof cardboard to create makeshift gutters in order to protect his laboratory's library from the rain.\nLeloir was known for his humility, focus and consistency, described by many as a \"true monk in science\". Every morning his wife Amelia would drive him in their  and drop him off at 1719 Juli\u00e1n Alvarez Street, location of Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Campomar, with Leloir wearing the same worn out, gray overalls. He worked sitting on the same straw seat for decades and encouraged colleagues to eat lunch in the laboratory to save time, bringing enough meat stew to share with everyone. Indeed, despite Leloir's frugality and extreme dedication to his research, he was a sociable man, claiming not to like working alone.\nThe Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Campomar has since been renamed , and has grown to become a 21,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (2,000\u00a0m) building with 20 senior researchers, 42 technicians and administrative personnel, 8 post doctorate fellows, and 20 Ph.D. candidates.

His parents were M\u00e1xima (Vapniarsky) and L\u00e1zaro Milstein, a  immigrant. He graduated from the  and obtained a PhD under Professor Stoppani (Professor of ). Thereafter, he was a member of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, England, and held dual Argentine and British citizenship. In 1956, he received an award from the Sociedad Bioqu\u00edmica Argentina for his work on  with the  aldehyde dehydrogenase. In 1958, funded by the , he joined the  Department at the  at  to work for a PhD under  on the mechanism of metal activation of the enzyme . During this work, he collaborated with  whose group he joined with a short-term  appointment.\nThe major part of Milstein's research career was devoted to studying the structure of antibodies and the mechanism by which antibody diversity is generated. It was as part of this quest that, in 1975, he worked with  (a postdoctoral fellow in his laboratory) to develop the  technique for the production of \u2014a discovery recognized by the award of the 1984 . This discovery led to an enormous expansion in the exploitation of antibodies in science and medicine.\nMilstein himself made many major contributions to improvements and developments in monoclonal antibody technology\u2014especially in the use of  to provide markers that allow distinction between different cell types. In collaboration with Claudio Cuello, Milstein helped lay the foundation for the use of monoclonal antibodies as probes for the investigation of the pathological pathways in neurological disorders as well as many other diseases. Milstein and Cuello's work also enabled the use of monoclonal antibodies to enhance the power of immuno-based diagnostic tests. In addition, Milstein foresaw the potential wealth of ligand-binding reagents that could result from applying recombinant  technology to monoclonal antibodies and inspired the development of the field of antibody engineering which was to lead to safer and more powerful monoclonal antibodies for use as therapeutics.\nMilstein's early work on antibodies focused on their diversity at the amino acid level, as well as on the disulfide bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies, where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted  that contained a signal sequence. The development of the  technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of  of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody . In this process, localized mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved , which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in recent years was devoted to characterizing this mutational process, with a view to understanding its mechanism. He contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.\nQuite apart from his own achievements, Milstein acted as a guide and inspiration to many in the antibody field, as well as devoting himself to assisting science and scientists in less developed countries. It is also worth mentioning, that even though the Nobel Prize would have made him a wealthy man, Milstein did not patent his enormous discovery since he believed that it was mankind's intellectual property. According to his beliefs, his work did not have any economic interest, only scientific.\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize 1984, Milstein was elected a , was a fellow of  from 1980 to 2002, awarded the  from  in 1980, won the  in 1989, and became a  in 1995. In 1993, the Argentinian  granted him the Diamond , one of the most prestigious cultural awards of Argentina, as the most important scientist in the last decade of his country.\nMilstein married Celia Prilleltensky in 1953.\nMilstein died early on 24 March 2002 in , England at age 74, as a result of a heart condition that he had suffered from for many years.\nThe film \"Un fueguito, la historia de C\u00e9sar Milstein\" was released in 2010.

He was joint recipient (with his father, ) of the  in 1915, \"For their services in the analysis of  by means of \"; an important step in the development of X-ray crystallography.\nBragg was  in 1941. As of 2020, he is the youngest ever  in physics, having received the award at the age of 25 years (youngest ever Nobel winner in any field is , who received Nobel Peace prize in 2014 at the age of 17). Bragg was the director of the , Cambridge, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was reported by  and  in February 1953.\nBragg was born in , South Australia to  (1862\u20131942),  Professor of Mathematics and Physics at the , and Gwendoline (1869\u20131929), daughter of , government astronomer of South Australia.\nHe showed an early interest in science and mathematics. Shortly after starting school he fell from his tricycle and broke his arm. His father, who had read about 's experiments in Europe and was performing his own experiments, used the newly discovered X-rays and his experimental equipment to examine the broken arm. This is the first recorded surgical use of X-rays in Australia.\nIn 1900, Bragg was a student at , followed by five years at . He went to the University of Adelaide at the age of 16 to study mathematics, chemistry and physics, graduating in 1908. In the same year his father accepted the Cavendish chair of physics at the , and brought the family to England. Bragg entered  in the autumn of 1909 and received a major scholarship in mathematics, despite taking the exam while in bed with . After initially excelling in mathematics, he transferred to the physics course in the later years of his studies, and graduated with first class honours in 1911. In 1914 Bragg was elected to a Fellowship at Trinity College \u2013 a Fellowship at a Cambridge college involves the submission and defence of a thesis.\nAmong Bragg's other interests was ; his personal collection amounted to specimens from some 500 species; all personally collected from South Australia. He discovered a new species of  \u2013 , named for him by .\nThe composition of X-rays was unknown, his father argued that X-rays are streams of particles, others argued that they are waves.  directed an X-ray beam at a crystal in front of a photographic plate; alongside of the spot where the beam struck there were additional spots from deflected rays \u2013 hence X-rays are waves. In 1912, as a first-year research student at Cambridge, W. L. Bragg, while strolling by the river, had the insight that crystals made from parallel sheets of atoms would not diffract X-ray beams that struck their surface at most angles because X-rays deflected by collisions with atoms would be out of phase, cancelling one another out. However, when the X-ray beam stuck at an angle at which the distances it passed between atomic sheets in the crystal equalled the X-ray's wavelength then those deflected would be in phase and produce a spot on a nearby film. From this insight he wrote the simple  that relates the wavelength of the X-ray and the distance between atomic sheets in a simple crystal to the angles at which an impinging X-ray beam would be reflected.\nHis father built an  in which a crystal could be rotated to precise angles while measuring the energy of reflections. This enabled father and son to measure the distances between the atomic sheets in a number of simple crystals. They calculated the spacing of the atoms from the weight of the crystal and the , which enabled them to measure the wavelengths of the X-rays produced by different metallic targets in the X-ray tubes. W. H. Bragg reported their results at meetings and in a paper, giving credit to \"his son\" (unnamed) for the equation, but not as a co-author, which gave his son \"some heartaches\", .\nBragg was commissioned early in  in the  as a  of the . In 1915 he was seconded to the  to develop a method to localise enemy artillery from the boom of their firing. On 2 September 1915 his brother was killed during the . Shortly afterwards, he and his father were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. He was 25 years old and remains the youngest science laureate. The problem with  was that the heavy guns boomed at too low a frequency to be detected by a microphone. After months of frustrating failure he and his group devised a hot wire air wave detector that solved the problem. In this work he was aided by , ,  and Henry Harold Hemming. British sound ranging was very effective; there was a unit in every British Army and their system was adopted by the Americans when they entered the war. For his work during the war he was awarded the  and appointed . He was also  on 16 June 1916, 4 January 1917 and 7 July 1919.\nHot wire sound ranging was used in  during which he served as a civilian adviser.\nBetween the wars, from 1919 to 1937, he worked at the  as  of Physics. He became the director of the  in Teddington in 1937.\nAfter World War II, Bragg returned to Cambridge, splitting the  into research groups. He believed that \"the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants\".\nWhen demobilised he returned to crystallography at Cambridge. They had agreed that father would study organic crystals, son would investigate inorganic compounds. In 1919 when , a long-time family friend, moved to Cambridge, Lawrence Bragg replaced him as Langworthy Professor of Physics at the . He recruited an excellent faculty, including former sound rangers, but he believed that his knowledge of physics was weak and he had no classroom experience. The students, many veterans, were critical and rowdy. He was deeply shaken but with family support he pulled himself together and prevailed. He and R. W. James measured the absolute energy of reflected X-rays, which validated a formula derived by C. G. Darwin before the war. Now they could determine the number of electrons in the reflecting targets, and they were able to decipher the structures of more complicated crystals like silicates. It was still difficult: requiring repeated guessing and retrying. In the late 1920s they eased the analysis by using  on the data.\nIn 1930 he became deeply disturbed while weighing a job offer from Imperial College, London. His family rallied around and he recovered his balance while they spent 1931 in Munich, where he did research.\nHe became director of the  in Teddington in 1937, bringing some co-workers along. However, administration and committees took much of his time away from the workbench.\nRutherford died and the search committee named Lawrence Bragg as next in the line of the  who direct the . The Laboratory had an eminent history in atomic physics and some members were wary of a crystallographer, which Bragg surmounted by even-handed administration. He worked on improving the interpretation of diffraction patterns. In the small crystallography group was a refugee research student without a mentor: . He showed Bragg X-ray diffraction data from , which suggested that the structure of giant biological molecules might be deciphered. Bragg appointed Perutz as his research assistant and within a few months obtained additional support with a grant from the . The work was suspended during the Second World War when Perutz was interned as an enemy alien and then worked in military research.\nDuring the war the Cavendish offered a shortened graduate course which emphasised the electronics needed for . Bragg worked on the structure of metals and consulted on sonar and sound ranging, they still used the Tucker microphone. He became Sir Lawrence in 1941. His father died in 1942, during which Bragg served for six months as Scientific Liaison Officer to Canada. He organised periodic conferences on X-ray analysis, which was widely used in military research.\nAfter the war he led in the formation of the  and was elected its first president. He reorganised the Cavendish into units to reflect his conviction that \"the ideal research unit is one of six to twelve scientists and a few assistants, helped by one or more first-class instrument mechanics and a workshop in which the general run of apparatus can be constructed.\" Senior members of staff now had offices, telephones and secretarial support. The scope of the department was enlarged with a new unit on radio astronomy. His own work focused on the structure of metals, using both X-rays and the . In 1947 he persuaded the  (MRC) to support what he described as the \"gallant attempt\" to determine protein structure as the , initially consisting of Perutz,  and two assistants. Bragg worked with them, by 1960 they had resolved the structure of  to the atomic level. After this he was less involved; their analysis of  was easier after they incorporated two mercury atoms as markers in each molecule. The first monumental triumph of the MRC was decoding the structure of DNA by  and . Bragg announced the discovery at a  on proteins in Belgium on 8 April 1953, it went unreported by the press. He then gave a talk at  in London on Thursday 14 May 1953, which resulted in an article by  in the  of London on Friday 15 May 1953, entitled \"Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life\". Bragg nominated Crick, Watson and  for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; Wilkins' share recognised the contribution of X-ray crystallographers at . Among them was , whose \"\" showed that DNA was a double , not the triple helix that  had proposed. Franklin died before the prize (which only goes to living people) was awarded.\nIn 1953 the Braggs moved into the elegant flat for the Resident Professor in the  in London, the position his father had occupied when he died. In 1934 and 1961 Lawrence had delivered the  and since 1938 he had been Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Institution, delivering an annual lecture. His father's successors had weakened the Institution, so Bragg had to rebuild it. He bolstered finances by enlisting corporate sponsors, the traditional Friday Evening Discourses were followed by a dinner party for the speaker and carefully selected possible patrons, more than 120 of them each year. \"Two of these Discourses in 1965 gave him particular pleasure. On 7 May, Lady Bragg, who had been a member of the Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce (1951\u201355) and was Chairman of the , lectured on 'Changing patterns in marriage and divorce'; and on 15 November, Bragg listened with evident pride to the Discourse on 'Oscillations and noise in jet engines' given by his engineer-son , who was then Chief Scientist at Rolls Royce Ltd and later became Vice-Chancellor of .\" He also introduced a programme of highly regarded Schools' Lectures, enlivened by the elaborate demonstrations that were a hallmark of the Institution. He gave three of these lectures on \"electricity\".\nHe continued research in the Institution by recruiting a small group to work the Davy-Faraday Laboratory in the basement and in the adjoining house, supported by grants he obtained. A visitor to the laboratory succeeded in inserting heavy metals into the enzyme ; the structure of its crystal was solved in 1965 at the Royal Institution by  and his coworkers, with the computations on the 9,040 reflections performed on the digital computer at the University of London, which greatly facilitated the work. Two of the illustrations of the positioning of amino acids in the chain were drawn by Bragg. Unlike myoglobin, in which nearly 80 per cent of the amino-acid residues are in the  conformation, in lysozyme the alpha-helix content is only about 40 per cent of the amino-acid residues found in four main stretches. Other stretches are of the , a conformation that they had proposed earlier. In this conformation, every third peptide is hydrogen-bonded back to the first peptide, thus forming a ring containing ten atoms. They had the complete structure of an enzyme in time for Bragg's 75th birthday. He became Professor Emeritus in 1966.\nX-ray analysis of protein structure flourished in subsequent years, determining the structures of scores of proteins in laboratories around the world. Twenty eight Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work using X-ray analysis. The disadvantage of the method is that it must be done on crystals, which precludes seeing changes in shape when enzymes bind substrates and the like. This problem was solved by the development of another line Bragg had initiated, using modified electron microscopes to image single frozen molecules: .\nIn his long association with the  he was:\nIn 1921 he married Alice Hopkinson (1899\u20131989), a cousin of a friend who had been killed in the war. They had four children, the engineer  (1923\u20132014), David William (1926\u20132005), Margaret Alice, born 1931, (who married the diplomat ) and Patience Mary, born 1935. Alice was on the staff at  until Bragg was appointed director of the National Physical Laboratory in 1937. She was active in a number of public bodies and served as  from 1945-46.\nBragg's hobbies included drawing \u2013 family letters were illustrated with lively sketches \u2013 painting, literature and a lifelong interest in gardening. When he moved to London, he missed having a garden and so worked as a part-time gardener, unrecognised by his employer, until a guest at the house expressed surprise at seeing him there. He died at a hospital near his home at , , Suffolk. He was buried in ; his son David is buried in the  in Cambridge, where Bragg's friend, who had he survived would have been his brother-in-law, Rudolph Cecil Hopkinson is also buried.\nIn August 2013, Bragg's relative, the broadcaster , presented a BBC Radio 4 programme (\"Bragg on the Braggs\") on the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics winners.\nBragg was elected a  \u2013 \"a qualification that makes other ones irrelevant\".

Although Graeme Hunter, in his book on Bragg , argued that he was more a crystallographer than a physicist, Bragg's lifelong activity showed otherwise\u2014he was more of a physicist than anything else.

However, the researchers did not have enough penicillin to help him to a full recovery, and he relapsed and died. Because of this experience and the difficulty in producing penicillin, the researchers changed their focus to children, who could be treated with smaller quantities of penicillin.\nFlorey's research team investigated the large-scale production of the mould and efficient extraction of the active ingredient, succeeding to the point where, by 1945, penicillin production was an industrial process for the Allies in World War II. However, Florey said that the project was originally driven by scientific interests, and that the medicinal discovery was a bonus:\nFlorey shared the  in 1945 with Ernst Boris Chain and Alexander Fleming.

He went on to conduct pioneering research in  and  at the , Melbourne, and served as director of the Institute from 1944 to 1965. From 1965 until his retirement in 1978, Burnet worked at the . Throughout his career he played an active role in the development of public policy for the medical sciences in Australia and was a founding member of the  (AAS), and served as its president from 1965 to 1969.\nBurnet's major achievements in microbiology included discovering the causative agents of  and ; developing  for the isolation, culture and detection of ; describing the recombination of influenza ; demonstrating that the  virus does not cause disease in humans. Modern methods for producing  are still based on Burnet's work improving virus growing processes in .\nBurnet was the most highly decorated and honoured scientist to have worked in Australia. For his contributions to Australian science, he was made the first  in 1960, and in 1978 a Knight of the . He was recognised internationally for his achievements: in addition to the Nobel, he received the  and the  and  from the , honorary doctorates, and distinguished service honours from the  and Japan.\nBurnet was born in , ; his father, Frank Burnet, a Scottish emigrant to Australia, was the manager of the Traralgon branch of the Colonial Bank. His mother Hadassah Burnet (n\u00e9e Mackay) was the daughter of a middle-class Scottish immigrant, and met his father when Frank was working in the town of . Frank was 36, and 14 years older than Hadassah. The family was socially conservative Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Frank Macfarlane Burnet was the second of seven children and from childhood was known as \"Mac\". He had an older sister, two younger sisters and three younger brothers. The eldest daughter Doris had a mental disability that consumed most of Hadassah's time and the family saw Doris's condition as an unspoken stigma, discouraging the other children from inviting friends home, lest they come across the eldest daughter. From his early years in Traralgon, Mac enjoyed exploring the environment around him, particularly Traralgon Creek. He first attended a private school run by a single teacher before starting at the government primary school at the age of 7. Mac was distant from his father\u2014who liked to spend his free time fishing and playing golf\u2014from a young age. He preferred bookish pursuits from a young age and was not enamoured of sport, and by the age of eight was old enough to analyse his father's character; Mac disapproved of Frank and saw him as a hypocrite who espoused moral principles and put on a facade of uprightedness, while associating with businessmen of dubious ethics. Hadassah was preoccupied with Doris, so Mac developed a rather solitary personality.\nThe Burnets moved to  in 1909, when Frank was posted to be the bank manager there, having declined a post in London. Burnet was interested in the wildlife around the nearby ; he joined the  in 1910 and enjoyed all outdoor activities. While living in Terang, he began to collect  and study biology. He read biology articles in the , which introduced him to the work of . During his early teens, the family took annual holidays to , where Burnet spent his time observing and recording the behaviour of the wildlife. He was educated at Terang State School and attended Sunday school at the local church, where the priest encouraged him to pursue scholastic studies and awarded him a book on ants as a reward for his academic performance. He advised Frank to invest in Mac's education and he won a full scholarship to board and study at , one of Victoria's most exclusive private schools. Starting there in 1913, Burnet was the only boarder with a full scholarship. He did not enjoy his time there among the scions of the ruling upper class; while most of his peers were brash and sports-oriented, Burnet was bookish and not athletically inclined, and found his fellow students to be arrogant and boorish. During this period he kept his beetle-collecting and disapproval of his peers a secret and mixed with his schoolmates out of necessity. Nevertheless, his academic prowess gained him privileges, and he graduated in 1916, placing first in his school overall, and in history, English, chemistry and physics. The typical university path for a person of his social background was to pursue studies in theology, law or medicine. By this time, he was becoming disillusioned with religion and chose medicine. Due to World War I, military service was a possibility and he felt that a medical background would increase his chances of being given a non-combat post.\nFrom 1918, Burnet attended the , where he lived in  on a residential scholarship. There, he read more of Darwin's work and was influenced by the ideas of science and society in the writings of . He enjoyed his time at university and spent much of his free time reading biology books in the library to feed his passion for scientific knowledge. He also had fleeting sporting success, holding down a position in Ormond's First VIII rowing squad for a brief period. He continued to pursue his study of beetles in private, although his classmates found out and there was no loss in this as they viewed his hobby positively. Despite an ongoing shyness, Burnet got on well with staff and students at university. Burnet was self-motivated and often skipped lectures to study at his own faster pace and pursue further knowledge in the library, and he came equal first in physics and chemistry in first year. The following year, 1918, he became increasingly immersed in laboratory work, but he was also dogged by peer pressure to enlist in the , which he saw as a distasteful prospect. However, this was averted by the end of the . In 1919, he was one of 12 high-performing students selected for extra tuition, and he came equal first in third year physiology. He began clinical work in the same year, but found it somewhat unpleasant as he was interested in diagnosing the patient and had little interest in showing empathy towards them.\nWhile at university, he became an  and later an aggressive atheist; he was sceptical of religious faith, which he regarded as \"an effort to believe what common sense tells you isn't true.\" He was also disgusted by what he regarded as hypocritical conduct by religious adherents. Towards the later years of his undergraduate years, his unhappiness with religion began to dog him to a greater extent. He tried to become involved with  for a brief period but then resolved to devote himself to scientific research. The length of time required to study medicine had been reduced to five years to train doctors faster following the outbreak of , and Burnet graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and a Bachelor of Surgery in 1922, ranking second in the final exams despite the death of his father a few weeks earlier. His fellow graduates included , , , Rupert Willis and , who became distinguished scientists in their own right.\nHe then did a ten-month residency at  to gain experience before going into practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under  and , both well known surgeons. He enjoyed this period immensely and was disappointed when he had to do his medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist , whom Burnet came to idolise. As a result of this he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the  was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, who was in charge of such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more suited to a laboratory research career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. Burnet complied.\nDuring the transition period he worked as a pathology registrar at the  and also prepared for his Doctor of Medicine examinations, late in 1923. In 1923 he took up the post of senior resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital; the laboratories were a part of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He conducted research into the  reactions in , leading to his first scientific publications. He decided to work full-time on the  response in , even though he was technically supposed to pursuing  as part of his obligations to the hospital. Burnet came first in the Doctor of Medicine exams by a long distance, and his score was excluded from the scaling process so that the other students would not fail for being so far behind.\nAt the time, the Hall Institute was in the early stages of rapid expansion. The new director of the Institute, , wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in ,  and  that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to Burnet and saw him as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on  in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the  at the  in . Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was free to do his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if  was affected by .\nHe was awarded the  by the Lister Institute in 1926; this gave him enough money for him to resign his curator position and he began full-time research on bacteriophages. He injected mice with bacteriophage and observed their immunological reactions and believed bacteriophages to be . For this work he received a Ph.D. from the  in 1928 under the direction of Professor  and was invited to write a chapter on bacteriophages for the  . He was also given an invitation to deliver a paper at the  in 1927 on the link between O-agglutinins and bacteriophage. Burnet began attending the  functions and befriended some communists, although he refrained from joining them in overt left-wing activism. He also spent his free time enjoying theatre, engaging in amateur  and cycling through continental Europe.\nWhile in London, Burnet became engaged to fellow Australian Edith Linda Marston Druce. She was a secondary school teacher and daughter of a barrister's clerk and the pair had met in 1923 and had a few dates but did not keep in touch. Druce sought out Burnet while on a holiday in London and they quickly agreed to marriage although she had to return to Australia. They married in 1928 after he had completed his Ph.D. and returned to Australia, and had a son and two daughters. At the time, there was a vacancy for the Chair of Bacteriology at the University of London, and Ledingham was lobbying his colleagues to offer Burnet the post, but Burnet returned to Australia, partly because of Druce.\nWhen Burnet returned to Australia, he went back to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, where he was appointed assistant director by Kellaway. His first assignment was to investigate the \"Bundaberg disaster\", in which 12 children had died after receiving a contaminated  vaccine. Kellaway was put in charge of a  to investigate the matter and he put Burnet in charge of the laboratory investigations. He identified  in the toxin- mixture that had been administered to the children; it had been picked up from the skin of one of the children and then transmitted to the others in the injections. However, it turned out to be another toxin that had caused the children's deaths; this work on staphylococcal toxin piqued his interest in immunology. During this time, he continued to study bacteriophages, writing 32 papers on phages between 1924 and 1937. In 1929, Burnet and his graduate assistant Margot McKie wrote a paper suggesting that bacteriophages could exist as a stable non-infectious form that multiplies with the bacterial host. Their pioneering description of  was not accepted until much later, and was crucial to the work of ,  and  on the replication mechanism and genetics of viruses, for which they were awarded the 1969 .\nBetween 1932 and 1933, Burnet took leave of absence to undertake a fellowship at the  in London. The Great Depression had resulted in Burnet's salary being cut from 1000 to 750 pounds, and the National Institute had been given a large grant from the  that allowed them to hire Burnet at 1000 pounds per annum. The National Institute's Director Sir  gained permission from Kellaway for the two-year move; Kellaway promised to hold Burnet's job for him when he returned and felt that the experience would make Burnet\u2014whom he saw as the Hall Institute's brightest young scientist\u2014better equipped to expand operations when he returned to Melbourne. Dale also paid for Burnet's sister to travel to England to help look after her brother's young children.\nSignificant breakthroughs in virology were made while he was there, including the isolation and first demonstration of the transmission of the  virus. His own research was on the , which he used in developing a chick embryo assay for the isolation and quantification of animal viruses. Dale offered Burnet a permanent position but he declined and returned to the Hall Institute. Following his productive work in London, the Rockefeller Institute agreed to fund a new virus research laboratory in Melbourne for Burnet. He brought back a set of viruses from the National Institute to begin the basis of research in Melbourne.\nWhen Burnet returned to Australia, he continued his work on virology, including the  of . He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of  and . After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban in order to prevent human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist , the causative organism of which was named  in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of herpes and Q fever displayed an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his scientific method.\nDuring World War II, Burnet's research moved to  and . With the outbreak of war, Burnet was handed more responsibility and made acting director and had to oversee the move into a new building as Kellaway was seconded to the military in 1939. Due to Kellaway, many of the infectious disease problems afflicting the military were referred to the Institute. Fearing a repeat of the massive global influenza outbreak that occurred after World War I, Burnet focused the Institute in the search for a vaccine. He first tested the vaccine on a group of medical students, and after a promising test on 107 army volunteers in February 1942 following a rise in infections, a large-scale program was introduced two months later to inoculate all new recruits after an influenza A outbreak. In this trial, 20,000 personnel were vaccinated, without success, and the scheme was abandoned. In 1942, the investigations into scrub typhus accelerated after an exodus of researchers in that field from  after the  conquest of the area. However, this ended in tragedy when his collaborator  accidentally injected herself and then died of the infection. Nevertheless, his work on immunisation had earned him international recognition by this time.\nBurnet's first book, , was published in 1940. It had wide influence and was translated into several languages. In 1942 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1944 he travelled to  to deliver the Dunham Lectures. There he was offered a chair, but he refused and returned to Australia. This was attributed to his nationalistic tendencies, as well as his sense of loyalty to the Hall Institute. During his trip he also visited the US military facility at , where he discussed his work on influenza with the scientists working there.\nIn 1944, he was appointed director of the Institute when Kellaway was appointed director of the . Although Kellaway had groomed Burnet to become a pivotal figure, he was hesitant as to whether Burnet would be at his most effective with a strategic leadership role. Kellaway thought that Burnet might not be suited to the post, and should have continued to focus purely on research for the time being. Burnet had similar doubts, particularly given his taciturn nature, but applied for the position anyway. Although he was not known for his social skills, his ability as a scientist and to impart ideas for investigation to his subordinates held his leadership and the Institute in good stead. Unlike his predecessor, who valued a broad gamut of research activities, Burnet was of the opinion that the Institute could not make a significant impact at global level in this way, and he pursued a policy of focusing all effort into one area at a time. Always a strong-willed and rather isolated man, he became more single-minded and less tolerant of criticism of his work and expected a more hierarchical structure and unquestioning obedience. According to biographer Sexton, he \"displayed a kind of territorial protectiveness in relation to his own work\".\nIn 1944, it was decided by the University of Melbourne that Burnet would be appointed a professor as part of a cooperative program so that university students could be experimentally trained at the Institute, while the researchers engaged in some teaching. This was not a success, and there was much tension, as Burnet repeatedly expressed his opinion in public that university teaching and research should be kept separate, at one point leading to a series of open letters from university professors decrying his attitude. Burnet was also not interested in the politics of university funding, and his disengagement from administrative matters engendered resentment. On the other hand, Burnet was vigorous in obtaining funding for the Hall Institute from government bodies, resorting to the bluff of feigning interest in moving overseas to secure continued strong backing. However, he was criticised for being thrifty and refusing to invest in cutting edge equipment, despite the Hall Institute's high standing in research circles. Colleagues believed that he was sceptical of modern technology and thought his outlook to be limiting.\nIn 1946, he initiated the Clinical Research Unit to allow for closer cooperation with the clinical activities of the now named . Despite his known derisive views of clinical science as being inferior, he supported the work enthusiastically.\nUnder Burnet's direction, scientists at the Institute made significant contributions to infectious disease research during a period that has been called the \"golden age of virology\". Virologists including , , , , and  made significant contributions on , , , , herpes and influenza.\nBurnet made significant contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including  assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the  that is secreted by , which later provided the foundation for  significant work on  and the neuraminidase substrate, . Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.\nIn 1957, Burnet decided that research at the Institute should focus on immunology. Burnet reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned and feeling the action was arrogant; for Burnet's part he was comfortable with the decision as he thought it to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the 's . After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on immunological problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to  and the  reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of immunology, immunological surveillance and cancer.\nAt the time, immunology was becoming more sophisticated, with the increasing role of  and . Burnet was suspicious of the direction in which immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude was a factor in his decision to turn the Institute's focus to immunology.\nBurnet began to switch his focus to immunology in the 1940s. In 1941 he wrote a  called \"The Production of Antibodies\", which was revised and reissued in 1949 with Frank Fenner as a co-author. This book is seen as a key publication in immunology\u2014it marks the move from the study of immunology as a chemical endeavour to a biological one. Importantly in this work, he introduced the concept of \"self\" and \"non-self\" to immunology. The distinction between self and non-self was an integral part of Burnet's biological outlook, of his interest in the living organism in its totality, its activities, and interactions. Burnet regarded the \"self\" of the host body as being actively defined during its embryogenesis through complex interactions between immune cells and all the other cells and molecules within an embryo.\nUsing the concept of self, Burnet introduced a hypothesis about the situation where the body failed to make antibodies to its own components () and by extension the idea of . He proposed that\nBurnet was, however, unable to prove this experimentally. ,  and  did find support for Burnet's hypothesis in 1953 when they showed that  could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not from any other mouse strain. Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet and Medawar were able to coordinate their work effectively despite their rather different personalities and physical separation; Burnet was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.\nHowever, later studies showed that cells or tissues transplanted before the immune system development of the recipient, such as in embryonic recipients, could be treated as foreign and trigger rejection, countering Burnet's explanation for self tolerance. In contrast to the Burnet hypothesis of a special tolerance-inducing period defined by the age of the animal,  proposed in 1959, that it is the age of the lymphocyte that defines whether an antigen that is encountered will induce tolerance, with immature lymphocytes being tolerance-sensitive. Lederberg's concept is now known as central tolerance, and is widely accepted. It may also explain the success of some transplants given early in life and the failure to induce tolerance in other studies. Burnet noted that his contributions to immune tolerance were strictly theoretical:\nBurnet was interested in how the body produces antibodies in response to antigens. The dominant idea in the literature through the 1940s was that the antigen acted as a template for antibody production, which was known as the \"instructive\" hypothesis. Burnet was not satisfied with this explanation, and in the second edition of \"The Production of Antibodies\", he and Fenner advanced an indirect template theory which proposed that each antigen could influence the genome, thus effecting the production of antibodies. In 1956 he became interested in 's natural selection hypothesis, which described a mechanism for immune response based on an earlier theory of Nobel-winning immunologist . Jerne proposed that the antigen bound to an antibody by chance and, that upon binding, more antibodies to that antigen would be produced. Burnet developed a model which he named  that expanded on and improved Jerne's hypothesis. Burnet proposed that each  bears on its surface specific immunoglobulins reflecting the specificity of the antibody that will later be synthesised once the cell is activated by an antigen. The antigen serves as a selective stimulus, causing preferential proliferation and differentiation of\nthe clones that have receptors for that antigen.\nIn 1958  and Lederberg showed that one  always produces only one antibody, which was the first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book . His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and  as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.\nThere is some contention over Burnet's publication of his version of the theory in the  in 1957. Some commentators argue he published in an Australian journal to fast-track his hypothesis and obtain priority for his theory over ideas that were published later that year in a paper written by , which Burnet had read prior to its publication. In his paper Burnet cited Talmage's review, and in a later interview, Talmage said he believed that Burnet \"truthfully had developed the idea before he received my paper\". The theory is now sometimes known as Burnet's clonal selection theory, which overlooks the contributions of Ehrlich, Jerne, Talmage, and the contributions of Lederberg, who conceptualised the genetics of clonal selection.\nBurnet's work on graft-versus-host was in collaboration with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this was known as the Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain  in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune . They looked at the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug  to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human autoimmune disease.\nIn 1960, Burnet scaled back his laboratory work, taking one day off per week to concentrate on writing. In 1963, , which he authored with , was published. He also oversaw an expansion of the Hall Institute and secured funding from the  and the state government to build two further floors in the building and take over some of the space taken up by the pathology department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Despite this, Burnet believed that a world class research body needed to be small enough that one person could effectively run it, and maintained tight control over its activities throughout his leadership. He determined the policies himself, and personally selected all of the research staff and students, relying on a small staff to enforce his plans.\nHe continued to be active in the laboratory until his retirement in 1965, although his experimental time began to decrease as the operations became increasingly focused on immunology; Burnet's work in this area had been mostly theoretical. Gustav Nossal became the next director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. Under Burnet's leadership the Institute had become \"probably the world's best known research centre devoted to the study of immunology.\" However, with the increasing sophistication in medical science and its reliance on more complicated technology, Burnet's lone-wolf approach became less compatible with the research environment, which required more collaboration. In his final years at the helm, Burnet allowed more technical modernisation during the transition period to Nossal's leadership.\nFrom 1937 Burnet was involved in a variety of scientific and public policy bodies, starting with a position on a government advisory council on polio. After he became the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1944, he was considered a public figure and overcame shyness to become a good public speaker. He recognised the importance of co-operation with the media if the general public was to understand science and scientists, and his writings and lectures played an important part in the formulation of public attitudes and policy in Australia on a variety of biological topics. However, despite making many appearances on radio and television, he never became at ease with interviews and had to be selective with outreach engagements due to the many invitations he received, and tended to accept those that had the potential to promote the Institute. Over time, he began to increase his activism, as he felt more confident that he would be able to make an impact as his reputation grew, especially after winning the Nobel Prize, and even more so after his retirement from the directorship of the Institute. Although Burnet was not naturally outgoing, he saw it as the social responsibility of a scientific leader and scholar to publicly speak out and impart wisdom and foresight to the wider community.\nBurnet served as a member or chairman of scientific committees, both in Australia and overseas. Between 1947 and 1953, he was a member of the 's Medical Research Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for medical research in Australia. During this same period (1947\u201352), he was also a member of the  Defence Research and Development Policy Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that Burnet made the recommendation that Australia pursue development of  and  to target neighbouring countries' food stocks and spread infectious diseases. His report was titled . Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; he was concerned that Australians were being exposed to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.\nInternationally, Burnet was a chairman of the Papua New Guinea Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1962 and 1969. At the time, Papua New Guinea was an Australian territory, and Burnet had first travelled there as his son was posted there. His role on the committee allowed him to explore his interest in . He was particularly interested in  (laughing sickness), and lobbied the Australian government to establish the Papua New Guinea Institute of Human Biology. Burnet later helped oversee the institute's contribution to the Anglo-Australian participation in the International Biological Programme in the Field of Human Adaptability.\nBurnet served as first chair for the  (1966\u201369), a Commonwealth initiative to foster interaction between the member countries' elite, and he was also active in the , serving on the Expert Advisory Panels on Virus Diseases and on Immunology between 1952 and 1969 and the World Health Organization Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1969 and 1973.\nIn 1964, he was appointed to sit on the University Council of Victoria's third university  on an interim basis until the institution was formed in 1966. He served until 1970. He advocated a less hierarchical relationship between a professor and student, something seen as a move away from the English tradition prevalent in Australia towards an American model. He also called for the downgrading of the importance placed on the liberal arts. His ideas were too radical for his peers and he stepped down from the role in 1970 after none of his suggestions had made an impact.\nBurnet was opposed to the use of nuclear power in Australia owing to the issues of . He later retracted his objections to , feeling that nuclear power was necessary while other renewable energy sources were being developed. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he was also vocal in the anti-smoking movement; he was one of the first high-profile figures in Australia to educate the public on the dangers of tobacco, and he appeared in a television advertisement criticising the ethics of , and broadcasters for displaying such material. He and fellow activists were surprised that the commercial was allowed to run briefly, before being taken off air by the station, which only further generated attention for the anti-smoking campaign. A former smoker, he had rejected the habit in the 1950s after several friends died. Burnet was also a critic of the  and called for the creation of an international police force.\nFollowing his resignation from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an office at the  in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books on a variety of topics including immunology, ageing and cancer, and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled , which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He was known for his ability to write quickly, often without a final draft, and his ability to convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had much influence. In 1969 he published , considered his magnum opus on immunity, which attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the clonal selection theory. The following year, he wrote , which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused work schedule, often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.\nHe became president of the  in 1965, having been a foundational fellow when the Academy was formed in 1954. He had been offered the presidency in 1958 to replace the inaugural head Sir , but declined, although he served on the council and as vice president in 1961\u201363. As president he was recognised by both government and the public as the leading scientist in Australia. His stature as a scientist gave him the gravitas to end policy disputes, and gave the Academy and its advocacy more credibility in the eyes of government and industry. As such his term was considered to be highly successful. Oliphant said that Burnet's personal prestige was very important in the increased respect the AAS won and that he \"made the biological sciences far more acceptable in Australia\".\nHe helped establish the Academy's Science and Industry Forum, which was formed in the second year of his leadership in order to improve dialogue between researchers and industrialists. It investigated whether a national science policy should be formulated and led to the eventual creation of the . He also laid the foundations of the . When his presidency ended in 1969, the Academy founded the , which is the Academy's highest award for biological sciences.\nAs in many of his previous pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group of the scientific community and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful due to a lack of concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members\u2014such as Burnet\u2014being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.\nIn 1966, Burnet accepted a nomination from Australia Prime Minister Sir  to become the inaugural chairman of the , a body that aimed to increase the professional interchange between the various nations of the . Burnet served in the role for three years and helped start it on a path of steady growth, although he was unable to use it as a personal platform to  espouse the importance of human biology.\nBurnet's essays and books published in his later life caused contention within the scientific community and to the chagrin of his peers Burnet often made pessimistic proclamations about the future of science. In 1966 Burnet wrote an opinion article for  entitled \"Men or Molecules?\" in which he questioned the usefulness of , arguing that it had not and would not contribute anything of use to medicine and that manipulation of the genome as had been demonstrated in bacteria would do more harm to humans than good. Gustav Nossal subsequently described Burnet as \"a biologist with a love-hate affair with biochemistry, which led to a brief but damaging rejection of the worth of molecular biology.\"\nHe delivered the inaugural Oscar Mendelsohn lecture in 1971 at  and advocated policies for Australia such as population control, prevention of war, long-term plans for the management of the environment and natural resources, Aboriginal land rights, socialism, recycling, advertising bans on socially harmful products, and more regulation of the environment. He angrily denounced French nuclear testing in the Pacific, and after consistently voting for the ruling Liberal Party coalition as it ruled for the past few decades, signed an open letter backing the opposition Labor Party of , which took power in 1972. However, he soon spoke out against Whitlam's lack of action against tobacco advertising and French nuclear tests. Burnet often found himself frustrated with the refusal of politicians to base policy on long-term objectives, such as the sustainability of human life.\nIn 1971\u201372, he wrote four books, most notably, , which caused great controversy due to its strident attacks on molecular biology, cellular biology, and claims that cancer and various other diseases were incurable and that it was pointless to try to do so. He also predicted that scientific progress would end soon.\nBurnet spoke and wrote widely on the topic of human biology after his retirement, aiming to reach all strata of society. He courted the media as well as the scientific community, often leading to sensationalist or scientifically unrigorous report of his outspoken views. This often angered colleagues, who viewed him as abusing his stature to deliberately cause a stir.  In 1966 Burnet presented the , focusing on human biology. He provided a conceptual framework for sustainable development; 21 years later the definition provided by the  was almost identical. In 1970 he revised an earlier book which was published as ; it was followed by , which was published in 1978. The books discuss aspects of human biology, a topic which Burnet wrote on extensively in his later years. In  he argued that the roots of all human behaviour can be found in the behaviour of animals; in  he addressed issues of ageing, life, death and the future of mankind. The books strongly polarised the scientific community, and one reviewer described his ideas of sociobiology as \"extreme\" and giving \"a dismal, unappealing view of humanity\". In , he also called for society to accept euthanasia of ill older people, repeat violent criminals, and most controversially, abortion of pregnancies likely to result in disabled children, and infanticide of handicapped newborns. Knowing that there would be a strong backlash for such policies, he departed overseas for a two-month lecture series at the time of the book launch. In his absence, he was strongly assailed in newspaper letters and some correspondents compared his stance on infanticide to that of . At the same time, he also changed his stance on nuclear power and advocated its use, and the reinvestment of revenue for research into solar power. This about face angered the environmental movement.\nHis first wife, Edith Linda Druce, died from lymphoid leukaemia in 1973, after a four-year struggle. During her final years, Burnet refused all offers of lectures overseas to spend more time nursing his ailing wife. For a period after this he became very lethargic and reclusive, numbed by his wife's death. He then moved into Ormond College for company, and resumed beetle collecting, but for a year after her death, Burnet tried to alleviate his grief by writing mock letters to her once a week. Gradually he regained his enthusiasm and began writing again. In 1975, he travelled to California to deliver a series of lectures. In 1976 he married Hazel G. Jenkins, a widowed former singer from a business family in her 70s who was working in the microbiology department as a librarian, and moved out of Ormond College.\nIn 1978 Burnet decided to officially retire; in retirement he wrote two books. During this time, he missed his laboratory work, and he was constrained to social events and theorising. In 1982, Burnet was one of three contributors to , writing about genetic issues and their impact on the nation's impact. As a result of the success of the book, in early 1983, Burnet was appointed to the 70-person Australian Advisory Council of Elders to offer counsel to policymakers, but the group folded after several members became too frail or died.\nBurnet continued to travel and speak, but in the early 1980s, he and his wife became increasingly hampered by illness. Having surmised his illness two years earlier, in November 1984 he underwent surgery for . He made plans to resume scientific meetings, but was then taken ill again, with significant pain in his thorax and legs. Secondary lesions were found in June 1985 and declared to be inoperable and terminal. A supporter of euthanasia, Burnet was unfazed by his imminent death, and he died on 31 August at his son's home at  after two months' of illness. He was given a state funeral by the government of Australia; many of his distinguished colleagues from the Hall Institute such as Nossal and Fenner were pall-bearers, and he was buried near his paternal grandparents after a private family service at  in Koroit, near Port Fairy. Following his death he was honoured by the ; Prime Minister  took the highly unusual step of moving a condolence motion, an honour typically reserved for parliamentarians. Lady Hazel Burnet died in 1990.\nBurnet received extensive honours for his contributions to science and public life during his lifetime. He was  in the , received the Elizabeth II Coronation Medal in 1953, and was appointed to the  (OM) in the 1958 . In 1960 he was the first recipient of the honorary  award. He received a Gold and Silver Star from the Japanese  in 1961.  He was appointed  (KBE) in the , and received the Elizabeth II Jubilee Medal in 1977. In 1978 he was made a  (AK). He was only the fourth person to receive this honour.\nHe was a fellow or honorary member of 30 international Academies of Sciences. He received 10 honorary  degrees from universities including Cambridge, Harvard and Oxford, an honorary  degree from Hahnemann Medical College (now part of ), an honorary Doctor of Medical Science from the  and a  degree from the University of Melbourne. Including his Nobel, he received 19 medals or awards including the  and the  from the Royal Society and the ; he also received 33 international lectureships and 17 lectureships within Australia.\nAfter his death, Australia's largest communicable diseases research institute\u2014the  was renamed in his honour. The Burnet Clinical Research Unit of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute was also named in his honour in 1986. In 1975 his work on immunology was recognised by a 33-cent stamp released by . Seven Australian medical scientists were commemorated in the issue of a set of four Australian stamps released in 1995; he appears on the 45-cent stamp with fellow University of Melbourne graduate . He also appears on a  stamp that was issued in 1997. The centenary of his birth was celebrated in Australia in 1999; a statue of him was erected in Franklin Street, Traralgon; and several events were held in his honour including the release of a new edition of  by Oxford University Press.\nBurnet biographer Christopher Sexton suggests that Burnet's legacy is fourfold: (1) the scope and quality of his research; (2) his nationalistic attitude which led him to stay in Australia, leading to the development of science in Australia and inspiring future generations of Australian scientists; (3) his success establishing the reputation of Australian medical research worldwide; and (4) his books, essays and other writings. In spite of his sometimes controversial ideas on science and humanity,  has noted that \"Burnet's reputation is secure in his achievements as an experimentalist, a theoretician and a leader of the Australian scientific community.\"\n\n\n", "bio_image": "full/4d0977c82cf45275a9ed3197e6f94a3456e67cff.jpg"},

He initially attended Warrnambool High School (now ) (where a science wing is named in his honour), then completed his final year of schooling at . Aged 17, he was awarded a senior scholarship to study medicine at the . As a medical undergraduate, he was never able to find a satisfactory explanation for the interaction of mind and body; he started to think about becoming a neuroscientist. He graduated (with first class honours) in 1925, and was awarded a  to study under  at , , where he received his Doctor of Philosophy in 1929.\nIn 1937 Eccles returned to Australia, where he worked on military research during . During this time Eccles was the director of Kanematsu Institute at , he and  gave research lectures at the , strongly influencing its intellectual environment. After the war, he became a professor at the  in New Zealand. From 1952 to 1962 he worked as a professor at the  (JCSMR) of the . The Eccles Institute of Neuroscience is headquartered in a new wing of the JCSMR building, constructed with the assistance of a $63M grant from the Commonwealth Government and completed in March 2012.\nIn the early 1950s, Eccles and his colleagues performed the research that would lead to his receiving the Nobel Prize. To study synapses in the peripheral nervous system, Eccles and colleagues used the stretch reflex as a model, which is easily studied because it consists of only two : a sensory neuron (the  fibre) and the . The sensory neuron synapses onto the motor neuron in the . When a current is passed into the sensory neuron in the , the motor neuron innervating the quadriceps produced a small  (EPSP). When a similar current is passed through the , the opposing muscle to the quadriceps, an  (IPSP) is produced in the quadriceps motor neuron. Although a single EPSP was not enough to fire an  in the motor neuron, the sum of several EPSPs from multiple sensory neurons synapsing onto the motor neuron can cause the motor neuron to fire, thus contracting the quadriceps. On the other hand, IPSPs could subtract from this sum of EPSPs, preventing the motor neuron from firing.\nApart from these seminal experiments, Eccles was key to a number of important developments in . Until around 1949, Eccles believed that  was primarily electrical rather than chemical. Although he was wrong in this hypothesis, his arguments led him and others to perform some of the experiments which proved chemical synaptic transmission.  and Eccles worked together on some of the experiments which elucidated the role of  as a  in the brain.\nHe was appointed a  in 1958 in recognition of services to physiological research.\nHe won the  Award in 1963, the same year he won the Nobel Prize.\nIn 1964 he became an honorary member to the , and in 1966 he moved to the United States to work at the  in Chicago. Unhappy with the working conditions there, he left to become a professor at the  from 1968 until he retired in 1975. After retirement, he moved to Switzerland and wrote on the .\nIn 1981, Eccles became a founding member of the .\nIn 1990 he was appointed a  of the  (AC) in recognition of service to science, particularly in the field of neurophysiology. He died in 1997 in , , Switzerland.\nIn  (1973), Eccles summarises his philosophy: \"Now before discussing brain function in detail I will at the beginning give an account of my philosophical position on the so-called 'brain-mind problem' so that you will be able to relate the experimental evidence to this philosophical position. I have written at length on this philosophy in my book . In Fig. 6-1 you will be able to see that I fully accept the recent philosophical achievements of  with his concept of three worlds. I was a , now I am a ! Cartesian dualism has become unfashionable with many people. They embrace  to escape the enigma of brain-mind interaction with its perplexing problems. But Sir Karl Popper and I are , and what is more, ! The three worlds are very easily defined. I believe that in the classification of Fig. 6-1 there is nothing left out. It takes care of everything that is in existence and in our experience. All can be classified in one or other of the categories enumerated under Worlds 1, 2 and 3.\n\n\"In Fig. 6-1, World 1 is the world of physical objects and states. It comprises the whole cosmos of matter and energy, all of biology including human brains, and all artifacts that man has made for coding information, as for example, the paper and ink of books or the material base of works of art. World 1 is the total world of the materialists. They recognise nothing else. All else is fantasy.\n\"World 2 is the world of states of consciousness and subjective knowledge of all kinds. The totality of our perceptions comes in this world. But there are several levels. In agreement with Polten, I tend to recognise three kinds of levels of World 2, as indicated in Fig. 6-2, but it may be more correct to think of it as a spectrum.\nFIG. 6-2, World of Consciousness\n\"The first level (outer sense) would be the ordinary perceptions provided by all our sense organs, hearing and touch and sight and smell and pain. All of these perceptions are in World 2, of course: vision with light and colour; sound with music and harmony; touch with all its qualities and vibration; the range of odours and tastes, and so on. These qualities do not exist in World 1, where correspondingly there are but electromagnetic waves, pressure waves in the atmosphere, material objects, and chemical substances.\n\"In addition there is a level of , which is the world of more subtle perceptions. It is the world of your emotions, of your feelings of joy and sadness and fear and anger and so on. It includes all your memory, and all your imaginings and planning into the future. In fact there is a whole range of levels which could be described at length. All the subtle experiences of the human person are in this inner sensory world. It is all private to you but you can reveal it in linguistic expression, and by gestures of all levels of subtlety.\n\"Finally, at the core of World 2 there is the  or , which is the basis of our unity as an experiencing being throughout our whole lifetime.\n\"This World 2 is our . Our conscious experiences are the basis of our knowledge of World 1, which is thus a world of , a derivative world. Whenever I am doing a scientific experiment, for example, I have to plan it cognitively, all in my thoughts, and then consciously carry out my plan of action in the experiment. Finally I have to look at the results and evaluate them in thought. For example, I have to see the traces of the oscilloscope and their photographic records or hear the signals on the loudspeaker. The various signals from the recording equipment have to be received by my sense organs, transmitted to my brain, and so to my consciousness, then appropriately measured and compared before I can begin to think about the significance of the experimental results. We are all the time, in every action we do, incessantly playing backwards and forwards between World 1 and World 2.\n\"And what is World 3? As shown in Fig. 6-1 it is the whole world of culture. It is the world that was created by man and that reciprocally made man. This is my message in which I follow Popper unreservedly. The whole of language is here. All our means of communication, all our intellectual efforts coded in books, coded in the artistic and technological treasures in the museums, coded in every artefact left by man from primitive times\u2014this is World 3 right up to the present time. It is the world of civilisation and culture. Education is the means whereby each human being is brought into relation with World 3. In this manner he becomes immersed in it throughout life, participating in the heritage of mankind and so becoming fully human. World 3 is the world that uniquely relates to man. It is the world which is completely unknown to animals. They are blind to all of World 3. I say that without any reservations. This is then the first part of my story.\n\"Now I come to consider the way in which the three worlds interact...\"\nDespite these words, in his late book , Eccles proposed a dualistic mechanism of mind.\nEccles had nine children. Eccles married Irene Miller Eccles (1904-2002) in 1928 and divorced in 1968. After his divorce in 1968, Eccles married Helena T\u00e1bor\u00edkov\u00e1; a fellow neuropsychologist and M.D. of Charles University. The two often collaborated in research and they remained married until his death. Eccles died on 2 May 1997 in his home of .

In 1973 he was awarded the , \"for an epic and psychological narrative art which has introduced a new continent into literature\", as it says in the Swedish Academy's citation, the only Australian to have been awarded the prize. White was also the inaugural recipient of the .\nWhite was born in , London, to Victor Martindale White and Ruth (n\u00e9e Withycombe), both Australians, in their apartment overlooking  on 28 May 1912. His family returned to Sydney, Australia, when he was six months old. As a child he lived in a flat with his sister, a nanny, and a maid while his parents lived in an adjoining flat.  In 1916 they moved to a house in  that many years later became a nursing home, Lulworth House, the residents of which included , , and White's partner .\nAt the age of four, White developed asthma, a condition that had taken the life of his maternal grandfather. White's health was fragile throughout his childhood, which precluded his participation in many childhood activities.\nHe loved the theatre, which he first visited at an early age (his mother took him to see  at the age of six). This love was expressed at home when he performed private rites in the garden and danced for his mother's friends.\nAt the age of five, he attended kindergarten at Sandtoft in , in Sydney's .\nAt the age of ten, White was sent to , a boarding school in  in the  of New South Wales, in an attempt to abate his asthma. It took him some time to adjust to the presence of other children. At boarding school, he started to write plays. Even at this early age, White wrote about palpably adult themes. In 1924, the boarding school ran into financial trouble, and the headmaster suggested for White to be sent to a  in England, a suggestion that his parents accepted.\nWhite struggled to adjust to his new surroundings at , England. He later described it as \"a four-year prison sentence\". White withdrew socially and had a limited circle of acquaintances. Occasionally, he would holiday with his parents at European locations, but their relationship remained distant. However he did spend time with his cousin Jack Withycombe during this period, and Jack's daughter  became a mentor to him while he was writing his first book of poems,  between the years 1927\u201329.\nWhile at school in London, White made one close friend, Ronald Waterall, an older boy who shared similar interests. White's biographer, , wrote that \"the two men would walk, arm-in-arm, to London shows; and stand around stage doors crumbing for a glimpse of their favourite stars, giving a practical demonstration of a chorus girl's high kick... with appropriate vocal accompaniment\". When Waterall left school, White withdrew again. He asked his parents if he could leave school to become an actor. The parents compromised and allowed him to finish school early if he came home to Australia to try life on the land. His parents felt that he should work on the land rather than become a writer and hoped that his work as a  would temper his artistic ambitions.\nWhite spent two years working as a  at Bolaro, a 73-square-kilometre (28\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) station near , on the edge of the , in southeastern Australia. Although he grew to respect the land and his health improved, it was clear that he was not cut out for this life.\nFrom 1932 to 1935, White lived in England, studying French and German literature at , . During his time at Cambridge he developed a romantic attraction to a young man who had come to King's College to become an Anglican priest. White dared not speak of his feelings for fear of losing the friendship and, like many other gay men of that period, he feared that his sexuality would doom him to a lonely life. Then, one night, the student priest, after an awkward liaison with two women, admitted to White that women meant nothing to him sexually. That became White's first love affair.\nDuring White's time at Cambridge he published a collection of poetry entitled , and wrote a play named , which was later performed by an amateur group (which included his sister Suzanne) at the tiny  in Sydney. After being admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1935, White briefly settled in London, where he lived in an area that was frequented by artists. There, the young author thrived creatively for a time, writing several unpublished works and reworking , a novel that he had written while jackarooing. In 1937, White's father died, leaving him ten thousand pounds in inheritance. The fortune enabled him to write full-time in relative comfort. Two more plays followed before he succeeded in finding a publisher for . The novel was received well in London but poorly in Australia. He began writing another novel, , but abandoned it before its completion after receiving negative comments, a decision that he later admitted regretting.\nIn 1936, White met the painter , 18 years his senior, who became an important influence in his life and work. The two men never became lovers but remained firm friends. In White's own words, \"He became what I most needed, an intellectual and aesthetic mentor\". They had many similarities: they were both gay and they both felt like outsiders in their own families; as a result they both had ambivalent feelings about their families and backgrounds, yet both maintained close and lifelong links with their families, particularly their mothers. They also both appreciated the benefits of social standing and connections and Christian symbolism and biblical themes are common in both artists' work.\nWhite dedicated his first novel  to De Maistre and acknowledged De Maistre's influence on his writing. In 1947, De Maistre's painting  was used as the cover for the first edition of White's . White bought many of De Maistre's paintings. In 1974 White gave all his paintings by De Maistre to the .\nTowards the end of the 1930s, White spent time in the United States, including , Massachusetts, and , which were artistic hotbeds at the time, where he wrote . By the time World War II broke out, he had returned to London and joined the British . He was accepted as an intelligence officer, and was posted to the Middle East. He served in Egypt, Palestine, and Greece before the war was over. While in the Middle East, he had an affair with a Greek army officer, , who was to become his life partner.\nWhite and Lascaris lived together in Cairo for six years before moving to a small farm purchased by White at , near Sydney, in 1948. After the death of White's mother in 1963, they moved into a large house, , in , where they lived for the rest of their lives.\nAfter the war, White once again returned to Australia, buying an old house in , now a Sydney suburb but then semi-rural. He named the house \"The Dogwoods,\" after trees he planted there. In this house, he settled down with Lascaris, the Greek he had met during the war. They lived there for 18 years, selling flowers, vegetables, milk, and cream as well as pedigreed puppies. During these years he started to make a reputation for himself as a writer, publishing  and  in the United States in 1955 and shortly after in the United Kingdom.  was released to rave reviews in the United States, but in what had become a typical pattern, it was panned in Australia. White had doubts about whether to continue writing after his books were largely dismissed in Australia (three of them having been called 'un-Australian' by critics), but, in the end, he decided to persevere. His first breakthrough in Australia came when his next novel, , won the inaugural .\nIn 1961, White published . It was to become both a bestseller and a prizewinner, gaining him a second Miles Franklin Award. In 1963, White and Lascaris decided to sell the house at Castle Hill. A number of White's works from the 1960s depict the fictional town of Sarsaparilla, including his collection of short stories, , and the play, . By now, he had clearly established his reputation as one of the world's great authors, but remained an essentially private person, resisting opportunities for interviews and public appearances although his circle of friends had widened significantly.\nIn 1968, White wrote , a searing character portrait of an artist. Many people drew links to the Sydney painter  (1904\u201384) and White's friend, the painter , but White denied the connections. Patrick White was an art collector who had, as a young man, been deeply impressed by his friends  and , and later said he wished he had been an artist.  By the mid-1960s, he had also become interested in encouraging dozens of young and less established artists, such as , , and . White was later friends with , the young star of Australian painting, in the 1970s. That friendship ended when White felt that Whiteley, a heroin addict, was deceitful and pushy about selling his paintings. A portrait of White by  won the 1962 .\nWhite decided not to accept any more prizes for his work, and he declined both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by  to work on a screenplay for  but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia's decision to participate in the . His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the , but in 1971, after losing to , he wrote to a friend: .\nNevertheless, in 1973, White did accept the Nobel Prize \"for an epic and psychological narrative art, which has introduced a new continent into literature\". His cause was said to have been championed by a Scandinavian diplomat resident in Australia. White enlisted Nolan to travel to Stockholm to accept the prize on his behalf. The award had an immediate impact on his career, as his publisher doubled the print run for  and gave him a larger advance for his next novel. White used the money from the prize to establish a trust to fund the , given annually to established creative writers who have received little public recognition. He was invited by the  to be seated on the floor of the House in recognition of his achievement. White declined, explaining that his nature could not easily adapt itself to such a situation. The last time such an invitation had been extended was in 1928, to .\nWhite was made  for 1974, but in a typically rebellious fashion, his acceptance speech encouraged Australians to spend the day reflecting on the state of the country. Privately, he was less than enthusiastic about it. In a letter to Marshall Best on 27 January 1974, he wrote: \"Something terrible happened to me last week. There is an organisation which chooses an Australian of the Year, who has to appear at an official lunch in  on . This year I was picked on as they had run through all the swimmers, tennis players, yachtsmen\".\nWhite and Lascaris hosted many dinner parties at Highbury, their Centennial Park home, in a leafy part of the affluent Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. In , his biographer  portrays White as a genial host but one who easily fell out with friends.\nWhite supported the conservative, business oriented  until the election of 's  government and, following the , he became particularly , making a rare appearance on national television to broadcast his views on the matter. White also publicly expressed his admiration for the historian , satirist , and unionist .\nDuring the 1970s, White's health began to deteriorate: his teeth were crumbling, his eyesight was failing, and he had chronic lung problems - however, he also became a more openly political person, and began sometimes commenting on current issues. He was among the first group of Companions of the  in 1975 but resigned in June 1976 in protest at the dismissal of the Whitlam government in November 1975 by the Governor-General Sir . In 1979, his novel  was shortlisted for the , but White requested that it to be removed to give younger writers a chance to win. (The prize was won by , who ironically was just four years younger than White.) Soon after, White announced that he had written his last novel, and from then on, he would write only for radio or the stage.\nDirector  introduced himself to White while walking down a Sydney street, some time after White had seen a politically loaded stage revue by Sharman, , which had been panned by Sydney newspaper critics, and had written a letter to the editor of a newspaper defending the show. White felt somewhat cautious at first, not least due to the gulf in age between them, but after a while the two men became friends and Sharman and his theatrical circle, as well as his visual style as a director, would inspire White to a couple of new plays, notably  with its satirical portrayal of a posh and vulgar upper-class Sydney society. A few years later, Sharman asked White if he could make a film of . White agreed and wrote the screenplay for the film.\nIn 1981, White published his autobiography, , which explored issues about which he had publicly said little such as his homosexuality, his dislike of the \"subservient\" attitude of Australian society towards Britain and the Royal family, and also the distance he had felt towards his mother. On , 1982, White addressed a crowd of 30,000 people, calling for a ban on  and for the destruction of .\nIn 1986 White released one last novel, , but it was published under the pen name \"Alex Xenophon Demirjian Gray\" with White named as editor.

It has been claimed that the  theory was ridiculed by established scientists and doctors, who did not believe that any bacteria could live in the acidic environment of the stomach.

The first 30 out of 100 samples showed no support for their hypothesis. However, it was discovered that the lab technicians had been throwing out the cultures after 2 days. This was standard practice for throat swabs where other organisms in the mouth rendered cultures as not useful after 2 days. Due to other hospital work, the lab technicians did not have time to immediately throw out the 31st test on the second day, and so it stayed from Thursday through to the Monday.

For this work, she was awarded the 2009 , sharing it with Greider and , becoming the first Australian woman Nobel laureate. She also worked in , and was controversially dismissed from the  Administration's .\n\nElizabeth Helen Blackburn, one of seven children, was born in , , on 26 November 1948 to parents who were both family physicians. Her family moved to the city of  when she was four, where she attended the Broadland House Church of England Girls' Grammar School (later amalgamated with ) until the age of sixteen. Upon her family's relocation to , she attended , and ultimately gained very high marks in the end-of-year final statewide matriculation exams. She went on to earn a  in 1970 and  in 1972, both from the  in the field of biochemistry. Blackburn then went to receive her  in 1975 from the , where she worked with Frederick Sanger developing methods to sequence DNA using RNA, as well as studying the bacteriophage . It was also here, the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge University, where Blackburn met her husband John Sedat. Blackburn's soon to be husband had taken a position at Yale, where she then decided to finish her postdoctoral. \u201cThus it was that love brought me to a most fortunate and influential choice: Joe Gall\u2019s lab at Yale.\u201d\nDuring her postdoctoral work at Yale, Blackburn was doing research on the protozoan  and noticed a repeating  at the end of the linear rDNA which varied in size Blackburn then noticed that this hexanucleotide at the end of the chromosome contained a TTAGGG sequence that was , and the terminal end of the chromosomes were palindromic. These characteristics allowed Blackburn and colleagues to conduct further research on the protozoan. Using the telomeric repeated end of , Blackburn and colleague Jack Szostak showed the unstable replicating plasmids of yeast were protected from degradation, proving that these sequences contained characteristics of telomeres. This research also proved the telomeric repeats of  were conserved evolutionarily between the species. Through this research, Blackburn and collaborators noticed the replication system for chromosomes was not likely to add to the lengthening of the telomere, and that the addition of these hexanucleotides to the chromosomes was likely due to the activity of an enzyme that is able to transfer specific functional groups. The proposition of a possible transferase-like enzyme led Blackburn and PhD student Carol W. Greider to the discovery of an enzyme with reverse transcriptase activity that was able to fill in the terminal ends of telomeres without leaving the chromosome incomplete and unable to divide without loss of the end of the chromosome. This 1985 discovery led to the purification of this enzyme in lab, showing the transferase-like enzyme contained both RNA and protein components. The RNA portion of the enzyme served as a template for adding the telomeric repeats to the incomplete telomere, and the protein added enzymatic function for the addition of these repeats.Through this breakthrough, the term \u201ctelomerase\u201d was given to the enzyme, solving the end-replication process that had troubled scientists at the time.\n works by adding base pairs to the overhang of DNA on the 3\u2019 end, extending the strand until DNA polymerase and an RNA primer can complete the complementary strand and successfully synthesize the double stranded DNA. Since DNA polymerase only synthesizes DNA in the leading strand direction, the shortening of the telomere results. Through their research, Blackburn and collaborators were able to show that the telomere is effectively replenished by the enzyme telomerase, which conserves cellular division by preventing the rapid loss of genetic information internal to the telomere, leading to cellular aging.\n\n\nOn January 1, 2016, Blackburn was interviewed about her studies, discovering telomerase, and her current research. When she was asked to recall the moment of telomerase discovery she stated:In 1978, Blackburn joined the faculty of the , in the Department of Molecular Biology. In 1990, she moved across the San Francisco Bay to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the  (UCSF), where she served as the Department Chair from 1993 to 1999 and was the Morris Herzstein Professor of Biology and Physiology at UCSF. Blackburn became a Professor Emeritus at UCSF at the end of 2015.\nBlackburn, co-founded the company Telomere Health which offers telomere length testing to the public, but later severed ties with the company.\nIn 2015, Elizabeth Blackburn was announced as the new President of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. \u201cFew scientists garner the kind of admiration and respect that Dr. Blackburn receives from her peers for her scientific accomplishments and her leadership, service and integrity,\u201d says Irwin M. Jacobs, chairman of Salk's Board of Trustees, on Blackburn's appointment as President of the Institute. \u201cHer deep insight as a scientist, her vision as a leader, and her warm personality will prove invaluable as she guides the Salk Institute on its continuing journey of discovery.\u201d \u00a0In 2017, she announced her plans to retire from the Salk Institute the following year.\nFor their research and contributions to the understanding of telomeres and the enzyme telomerase, Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider, and Jack Szostaks were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The substantial research on the effects of chromosomal protection from telomerase, and the impact this has on cellular division has been a revolutionary catalyst in the field of molecular biology. For example, the addition of telomerase to cells that do not possess this enzyme has shown to bypass the limit of cellular aging in those cells, thereby linking this enzyme to reduced cellular aging. The addition of telomerase, and the presence of the enzyme in cancer cells has been shown to provide an immunity mechanism for the cell in proliferating, linking the transferase activity to increased cellular growth and reduced sensitivity for cellular signalling. The importance of discovering this enzyme has since sent led her continued research at the University of California San Francisco, where she studies the effect of telomeres and telomerase activity on cellular aging.\nBlackburn was appointed a member of the  in 2002. She supported human embryonic cell research, in opposition to the Bush Administration. Her Council terms were terminated by  directive on 27 February 2004. Dr. Blackburn believes that she was dismissed from the Council due to her disapproval of the Bush administration's position against stem cell research. This was followed by expressions of outrage over her removal by many scientists, 170 of whom signed an open letter to the president maintaining that she was fired because of political opposition to her advice.\nScientists and ethicists at the time even went as far to say that Blackburn's removal was in violation of Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which \u201crequires balance on such advisory bodies\u201d\n\"There is a growing sense that scientific research\u2014which, after all, is defined by the quest for truth\u2014is being manipulated for political ends,\" wrote Blackburn. \"There is evidence that such manipulation is being achieved through the stacking of the membership of advisory bodies and through the delay and misrepresentation of their reports.\"\nBlackburn serves on the Science Advisory Board of the Regenerative Medicine Foundation formerly known as the Genetics Policy Institute.\nBlackburn's first book  (2017) was co-authored with  Dr. Elissa Epel of Aging, Metabolism, and Emotions (AME) Center at the UCSF Center for Health and Community. Blackburn comments on aging reversal and care for one's telomeres through lifestyle: managing chronic stress, exercising, eating better and getting enough sleep; telomere testing, plus cautions and advice. While studying telomeres and the replenishing enzyme, telomerase, Blackburn discovered a vital role played by these protective caps that revolved around one central idea: aging of cells. The book hones in on many of the effects that poor health can have on telomeres and telomerase activity. Since telomeres shorten with every division of a cell, replenishing these caps is essential to long term cell growth. Through research and data, Blackburn explained that people that lead stressful lives exhibit less telomerase functioning in the body, which leads to a decrease in the dividing capabilities of the cell. Once telomeres shorten drastically, the cells can no longer divide, meaning the tissues they replenish with every division would therefore die out, highlighting the aging mechanism in humans. To increase telomerase activity in people with stress-filled lives, Blackburn suggests moderate exercise, even 15 minutes a day, which has been proven to stimulate telomerase activity and replenish the telomere.\nBlackburn also states that unhappiness in lives also has an effect on the shortening of telomeres. In a study done on divorced couples, their telomere length was \"significantly shorter\" compared to couples in healthy relationships, and Blackburn states, \"There's an obvious stressor... we are intensely social beings.\" She suggests to include positivity into our daily lives to increase health as well. While increasing the amount of exercise, decreasing stress, tobacco use, and maintaining a balanced sleep schedule, Blackburn explains that our telomeres can be drastically maintained and prevented from rapid shortening, leading to a decrease in the aging process of our cells. Blackburn also tells the readers to be wary of clinical pills who proclaim to lengthen or telomeres and protect the body from aging. She says that these pills and creams have no scientific proof of being anti-aging supplements, and that the key to preserving our telomeres and stimulating telomerase activity comes from leading a healthy life.\nIn recent years Blackburn and her colleagues have been investigating the effect of stress on telomerase and telomeres with particular emphasis on  meditation. She is also one of several biologists (and one of two Nobel Prize laureates) in the 1995 science documentary . Studies suggest that chronic psychological stress may accelerate ageing at the cellular level. Intimate partner violence was found to shorten telomere length in formerly abused women versus never abused women, possibly causing poorer overall health and greater morbidity in abused women.\nAt the University of California San Francisco, Blackburn currently researches telomeres and telomerase in many organisms, from yeast to human cells. The lab is focused on telomere maintenance, and how this has an impact on cellular aging. Many chronic diseases have been associated with the improper maintenance of these telomeres, thereby effecting cellular division, cycling, and impaired growth.

He married the daughter of president . Saavedra Lamas achieved renown not only as foreign minister of Argentina for his practical work in drafting international agreements and in conducting international mediation, but also as a professor for his scholarship in the fields of labor legislation and international law.\nSaavedra Lamas was a distinguished student at Lacordaire College and at the  where he received the Doctor of Laws degree in 1903, . After study in Paris and travel abroad, he accepted a professorship in law and constitutional history at the , where he began the teaching career that was to span more than forty years. Later, he inaugurated a course in sociology at the University of Buenos Aires, taught political economy and constitutional law in the Law School of the university, and eventually served as the president of the university.\nSaavedra Lamas was a leading Argentine academician in two areas. A pioneer in the field of labor legislation, he edited several treatises on labor legislation in Argentina and on the need for a universally recognized doctrine on the treatment of labor - among them, Centro de legislac\u00edon social y del trabajo (1927) [Center of Social and Labor Legislation], Trait\u00e9s internationaux de type social (1924), C\u00f3digo nacional del trabajo (three volumes, 1933) [National Code of Labor Law]. In the arena of practical affairs, Saavedra Lamas drafted legislation affecting labor in Argentina, supported the founding of the International Labor Organization in 1919, and presided over the ILO Conference of 1928 in Geneva while serving simultaneously as leader of the Argentine delegation.\nIn international law, his other field of major scholarly interest, he published \"La Crise de la codification et de la doctrine Argentine de droit international\" (1931); and he spoke, wrote, or drafted legislation on many subjects with international ramifications - among them, asylum, colonization, immigration, arbitration, and international peace. His brief Vida internacional, which he wrote at the age of seventy, is an urbane by-product of all this study and experience.\nSaavedra Lamas began his political career in 1906 as director of Public Credit and then became the secretary-general for the municipality of Buenos Aires in 1907. In 1908 he was elected to the first of two successive terms in Parliament. There he initiated legislation regarding coastal water rights, irrigation, sugar production, government finances, colonization, and immigration. His main interest, however, lay in foreign affairs. He provided leadership in saving Argentina's arbitration treaty with Italy, which almost foundered in 1907-1908, and eventually became the unofficial adviser to both the legislature and the foreign office on the analysis and implications of proposed foreign treaties. Saavedra Lamas though was also a controversial public figure as he was seen by the masses as an elitist patrician who was too conservative and favored British intervention, especially in railroad construction.\nAppointed minister of Justice and Education in 1915, he instituted educational reforms by integrating the different divisions of public education and by developing a curriculum at the intermediate level for the vocational and technical training of manpower needed in a developing industrial country.\nWhen General  became president of Argentina in 1932, he appointed Saavedra Lamas as foreign minister. In this post for six years, Saavedra Lamas brought international prestige to Argentina. He played an important role in every South American diplomatic issue of the middle thirties, induced Argentina to rejoin the League of Nations after an absence of thirteen years, and represented Argentina at virtually every international meeting of consequence during this period.\nHis work in ending the  between Paraguay and Bolivia (1932\u20131935) had not only local significance but generalized international importance as well. When he took over the foreign office, he immediately engaged in a series of moves to lay the diplomatic groundwork for a negotiated settlement of this dispute. In 1932 he initiated at Washington the Declaration of August 3 which put the American states on record as refusing to recognize any territorial change in the hemisphere brought about by force. Next, he drew up a Treaty of Nonaggression and Conciliation which was signed by six South American countries in October, 1933, and by all of the American countries at the Seventh Pan-American Conference at Montevideo two months later. In 1935 he organized mediation by six neutral American nations which resulted in the cessation of hostilities between Paraguay and Bolivia. Meanwhile, in 1934, Saavedra Lamas presented the South American Antiwar Pact to the League of Nations where it was well received and signed by eleven countries. Acclaimed for all of these efforts, he was elected president of the Assembly of the League of Nations in 1936.\nAfter his retirement from the foreign ministry in 1938, Saavedra Lamas returned to academic life, became president of the University of Buenos Aires for two years (1941\u20131943), and rounded out his career as a professor for an additional three years (1943\u20131946).\nSaavedra Lamas was known as a strict disciplinarian in his office, a logician at the conference table, a charming host in his home or his art gallery, and a man of sartorial elegance who wore, it is said, the highest collars in Buenos Aires. In addition to the , he was awarded the  and analogous honors from ten other countries.\nHe died in 1959 at the age of eighty from the effects of a brain hemorrhage.\nIn March 2014 his solid gold Nobel medal was put up for auction after being found in a South American pawn shop.\nIn August 2014 a project for rebuying his Nobel medal by the Argentine Nation was presented at the Argentine congress. His auctioned medal was later won and is now owned by a private Asian collector.\n\n", "bio_image": "full/dfe7bd81cfe9c364f1d2ed94625c2e8ecd1530ac.jpg"},

Luis Leloir is buried in , .\nLeloir's parents, Federico Augusto Rufino Leloir Bernal and Hortensia Aguirre de Leloir, traveled from Buenos Aires to Paris in the middle of 1906 with the intention of treating Federico's illness. However, Federico died in late August, and a week later Luis was born in an old house at 81 V\u00edctor Hugo Road in Paris, a few blocks away from the .

His education was divided between Escuela General San Mart\u00edn (primary school),  (secondary school), and for a few months at  in . His grades were unspectacular, and his first stint in college ended quickly when he abandoned his architectural studies that he had begun in Paris' .\nIt was during the 1920s that Leloir invented  (golf sauce). After being served prawns with the usual sauce during lunch with a group of friends at the Ocean Club in Mar del Plata, Leloir came up with a peculiar combination of ketchup and mayonnaise to spice up his meal. With the financial difficulties that later plagued Leloir's laboratories and research, he would joke, \"If I had patented that sauce, we'd have a lot more money for research right now.\"\nAfter returning again to , Leloir obtained his Argentine citizenship and joined the Department of Medicine at the  in hopes of receiving his doctorate. However, he got off to a rocky start, requiring four attempts to pass his anatomy exam. He finally received his diploma in 1932 and began his residency in the  and his medical internship in Ramos Mej\u00eda hospital. After some initial conflicts with colleagues and complications in his method of treating patients, Leloir decided to dedicate himself to research in the laboratory, claiming that \"we could do little for our patients... antibiotics, psychoactive d, and all the new therapeutic agents were unknown [at the time].\"\nIn 1933, he met , who pointed Leloir towards investigating in his doctoral thesis the  and carbohydrate metabolism. Houssay happened to be friends with , the brother-in-law of , one of Leloir's cousins. Following the recommendation of Udaondo, Leloir began working with Houssay, who in 1947 would later win the . The two would develop a close relationship, collaborating on various projects until Houssay's death in 1971; in his lecture after winning the Nobel Prize, Leloir claimed that his \"whole research career has been influenced by one person, Prof. Bernardo A. Houssay\".\nAfter only two years, Leloir received recognition from the medical department at UBA for having produced the best doctoral thesis. Feeling that his knowledge in fields such as , , , and  was lacking, he continued attending classes at the University as a part-time student. In 1936 he traveled to England to begin advanced studies at the , under the supervision of another Nobel Prize winner, Sir , who had obtained that distinction in 1929 for his work in  and in revealing the critical role of  in maintaining good health. Leloir's research in the Biochemical Laboratory of Cambridge centered around , more specifically the effects of  and  on succinic dehydrogenase; from this moment Leloir began to specialize in researching carbohydrate metabolism.\nLeloir returned to Buenos Aires in 1937 after his brief stay at Cambridge. 1943 saw Leloir marry; Luis Leloir and Amelia Zuberbuhler (1920-2013) would later have a daughter also named Amelia. However, his return to Argentina was amidst conflict and strife;  Houssay had been expelled from the University of Buenos Aires for signing a public petition opposing the  regime in  and the military government led  by . Leloir fled to the , where he assumed the position of associate professor in the Department of  at , collaborating with  and  and thereafter worked with  at the College of Physicians and Surgeons,  as a research assistant. Leloir would later credit Green with instilling within him the initiative to establish his own research in Argentina.\nIn 1945, Leloir ended his exile and returned to Argentina to work under Houssay at the , which Leloir would direct from its creation in 1947 by businessman and patron . Initially, the institute was composed of five rooms, a bathroom, central hall, patio, kitchen, and changing room. During the final years of the 1940s, although lacking financial resources and operating with very low-cost teams, Leloir's successful experiments would reveal the chemical origins of sugar synthesis in  as well as the  of  in the liver; together with J. M. Mu\u00f1oz, he produced an active cell-free system, a first in scientific research. It had initially been assumed that in order to study a cell, scientists could not separate it from its host organism, as oxidation could only occur in intact cells. Along the way, Mu\u00f1oz and Leloir, unable to procure the costly centrifuge needed to separate cell contents, improvised by spinning a tire stuffed with salt and ice.\nBy 1947 he had formed a team that included \nCaputto, Enrico Cabib, Ra\u00fal Trucco, Alejandro Paladini, Carlos Cardini and Jos\u00e9 Luis Reissig, with whom he investigated and discovered why a malfunctioning kidney and  helped cause . That same year,  his colleague , in his investigations of the , made discoveries regarding carbohydrate storage and its subsequent transformation into a reserve energy form in organisms.\nAt the beginning of 1948, Leloir and his team identified the sugar nucleotides that were fundamental to the metabolism of carbohydrates, turning the Instituto Campomar into a biochemistry institution well known throughout the world. Immediately thereafter, Leloir received the Argentine Scientific Society Prize,  one of the many awards he would receive both in Argentina and internationally. During this time, his team dedicated itself to the study of ; Leloir and his colleagues elucidated the primary mechanisms of galactose metabolism (now coined the ) and determined the cause of galactosemia, a serious  that resulted in .\nThe following year, he reached an agreement with Rolando Garc\u00eda, dean of the  at UBA, which named Leloir, Carlos Eugenio Cardini and Enrico Cabib as titular professors in the University's newly founded Biochemical Institute. The Institute would help develop scientific programs in budding Argentine universities as well as attract researchers and scholars from the United States, , England, France, Spain, and other Latin American countries.\nFollowing Campomar's death in 1957, Leloir and his team applied to the  in the United States desperate for funding, and surprisingly was accepted. In 1958, the Institute found a new home in a former all-girls school, a donation from the Argentine government. As Leloir and his research gained greater prominence, further research came from the Argentine Research Council, and the Institute would later become associated with the University of Buenos Aires.\nAs his work in the laboratory was coming to an end, Leloir continued his teaching position in the Department of Natural Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires, taking a hiatus only to complete his studies at Cambridge and at the Enzyme Research Laboratory in the United States.\nIn 1983, Leloir became one of the founding members of the Third World Academy of Sciences, later renamed the .\nOn December 2, 1970, Leloir received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry from the King of  for his discovery of the  in , becoming only the third Argentine to receive the prestigious honor in any field. In his acceptance speech at , he borrowed from 's famous 1940 speech to the  and remarked, \"never have I received so much for so little\".

The $80,000 prize money was spent directly on research, and when asked about the significance of his achievement, Leloir responded:\nLeloir published a short autobiography, entitled \"Long Ago and Far Away\" in the 1983 . The title, Leloir claims, is derived from one of 's novels that depicted the country wildlife and scenery of Leloir's childhood.\nHe died in Buenos Aires December 2, 1987, of a heart attack soon after returning to his home from the laboratory, and is buried in . , a friend and colleague of Leloir, claims that his lasting legacy was proving that \"scientific research on an international level, although precarious, was possible in an underdeveloped country in the middle of political strife\" and credits Leloir's vigilance and will for his ultimate success. With his research in dire financial straits, Leloir often resorted to homemade gadgets and contraptions to continue his work in the laboratory. In one instance, Leloir reportedly used waterproof cardboard to create makeshift gutters in order to protect his laboratory's library from the rain.\nLeloir was known for his humility, focus and consistency, described by many as a \"true monk in science\".
